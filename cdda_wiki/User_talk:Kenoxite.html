<p>Bot's done updating items to 0.8.  Weight seems to be all good to go!  I added the quote template as you suggested, but I only did it if the page had text that exactly matched the in-game description. So if people had altered the text for typos or to add links, it didn't catch those.
</p><p>I also had it remove all those pesky &lt;nowiki&gt; tags from the Infobox parameters.  They were interfering with our ability to do math or comparisons on them. Now, we can possibly use #expr <a class="external text" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:ParserFunctions.html">Parser functions</a> to make the boxes reactive to positive/negative values or whatever.
</p><p>I'll run over the crafting boxes, too, at some point soon. <a href="./User:BMacZero.html" title="User:BMacZero">BMacZero</a> (<a href="./User_talk:BMacZero.html" title="User talk:BMacZero">talk</a>) 21:50, 17 September 2013 (PDT)

<dl><dd>Great stuff as always, BMacZero. I can't stress enough how useful your bot is. I'll start updating and isolating the descriptions later, once I finish other sections. BTW, one where your bot would be more than welcomed is the <a href="./Crafting.html" title="Crafting">crafting</a> page. Can you look into that? So far I only updated the weapons section. Also, note that there you used the code names for the used skills, but not the skill names proper (gun instead of firearms, I did a quick find &amp; replace yesterday to fix them). I guess you should consider parsing them through skills.json. Again, if for any reason you can't do all this just let me know and I'll update that page manually. --<a href="./User:Kenoxite.html" title="User:Kenoxite">Kenoxite</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:22, 18 September 2013 (PDT)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think I already have some code for generating that crafting table. I'll run it when I get a chance (probably tonight). Thanks for pointing out the skills thing. I think the best solution to that is to just update <a href="./Template:SKtoname.html" title="Template:SKtoname">Template:SKtoname</a> so that it maps the game identifiers to the real names. All the skills get run through that template before they're shown already. It just seems to be expecting "sk_" prefixes on everything, which they don't have. <a href="./User:BMacZero.html" title="User:BMacZero">BMacZero</a> (<a href="./User_talk:BMacZero.html" title="User talk:BMacZero">talk</a>) 09:20, 18 September 2013 (PDT)
<dl><dd>Good Idea. Actually, I just created a new template: <a href="./Template:SKtoname1.html" title="Template:SKtoname1">Template:SKtoname1</a>. It replaces any skill listed in skills.json to their in-game name.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weight_update">Weight update</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed that since the game has started using the new weight system, the wiki doesn't seem to understand the new values. What do we need to do to get it up to date? <a href="./User:Rivet.html" title="User:Rivet">Rivet</a> (<a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User_talk:Rivet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User talk:Rivet (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:20, 21 August 2013 (PDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>For that most of the used templates and quite a lot of the items themselves will need to be updated. In the case of the ammo, which seem to be what you're focusing on, the template needing change would be <a href="./Template:Ammo.html" title="Template:Ammo">this one</a>. You'll see there the formula used to calculate the displayed weight:</dd></dl>
<pre>  |weight={{#expr: {{{weight|0}}}/100.0}}
</pre>
<dl><dd>According to the <a class="external text" href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/2073%7Clast.html" rel="nofollow">weight update changelog</a>:
<ul><li>In-game weights are now displayed to the 1/10th of a lbs/kg</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>So it should be:</dd></dl>
<pre>  |weight={{#expr: {{{weight|0}}}*0.001}}
</pre>
<dl><dd>For a complete list of the weight changes <a class="external text" href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/2073/files%7C.html" rel="nofollow">this commit</a> should be revised, but lots of entries lack context (name of item is left out) and the code itself should be used instead.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>As a general note regarding templates, you can always see a list of the used ones by any page when editing such page. It'll be displayed at the bottom. Most item pages use them now, so to make a global change like this the template should be edited. If the item itself has changed then you'll also need to edit the item page proper.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I've updated the ammo and firearms template myself and will look into others after posting this. I'll focus on updating templates, not items, but I might update some of them too. I'll see. Feel free to help.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>EDIT: The item list pages should also be updated. Both the page themselves to update individual item weights and the row templates. For example, I had to update both the <a href="./Handguns.html" title="Handguns">handguns</a> list page and the <a href="./Template:Row/Firearms.html" title="Template:Row/Firearms">firearms row template</a> for the handguns. Updating all the templates and items is going to be quite a huge task. Maybe we should leave this to the bots.</dd></dl>

<p>Weight system was change, but it's still in <i><b>experimental builds</b></i>, should wiki describe that before it goes <i><b>stable</b></i>? I'm not against it, but people who come here searching information should probably know that. Version system of  <a class="external text" href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php.html" rel="nofollow">dwarffortresswiki</a> is nice, but probably overkill here. --<a href="./User:Cootue.html" title="User:Cootue">Cootue</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cootue.html" title="User talk:Cootue">talk</a>) 01:15, 22 August 2013 (PDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>You're right, I should have taken that into consideration. We probably should keep this on hold until 0.8 is out. So far only the firearms templates where changed, though, and they could be reverted in any case if it looks problematic.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>And, yes, that feature you mention might be a bit too much for this wiki as of now, although I guess there's someone around there willing to get their hands into it.</dd>

<p>Would the bot update the headers for the firearms?

</p>
<dl><dd>That could be done manually. For that you'd need to create a new table header that includes any missing info, then the row templates and finally the weapon entries themselves. If you don't know how I can look into it myself. Just remind me again if it's not updated a week or so after 0.8.</dd>

<dl><dd>That's me forgetting about the whole item pages revamp. I'll update them to the page links proper later, both in the guide and the redirects. The rest of anchor links you might see still around are legacy before BMacZero started to use the bot to create all the item pages.

<h2><span id="Bot_for_0.9?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Bot_for_0.9.3F">Bot for 0.9?</span></h2>
<p>Hey! Good to see you back. Don't get burnt out :) do you know how to run the bot for all our new content or who we can poke to get it done? I tried bmac but only on the wiki. --<a href="./User:Mattamue.html" title="User:Mattamue">Mattamue</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Mattamue.html" title="User talk:Mattamue">talk</a>) 21:30, 20 November 2013 (PST)
</p>
<dl><dd>BMacZero is the only bot user that I'm aware of. Try to send him a PM in the forums, but he might not be interested anymore or doesn't have the time to run it. There's also been a lot of internal changes lately (my embedding system, new variables for pages -in fact, all those present in the jsons, unlike the selected few we were using before, etc). All this adds to the workload we put on him and, being all contributions to this wiki voluntary, I'm sure it doesn't help.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Personally, I'm not planning on using or creating a bot. There's enough work to do with other aspects other than adding new entries. The task I set myself that I discontinued during my burn-out break. If you remember, there's TONS of work still to be done. Work that can last from weeks (if coordinated) to months (if solo).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>What I've been looking into is ways of mixing manual and automated processes. See the <a href="./Category:Enemies.html" title="Category:Enemies">Category:Enemies</a> page to check one feature I'm testing (read the box and use the link). As you'll see, mediawiki allows to preload templates on page creation, so you'd only need to add the data from the json and not create the whole page as before. Although I have yet to decide the exact procedure, a possible implementation would include support for <a class="external text" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:External_Data.html">this extension</a> and, finally, a tweaked version of <a class="external text" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Add_Article_to_Category.html">this one</a>. All this would allow to add new pages just by typing the name (or id) of the new item/creature/etc in an input box, then the new page would be automatically created and all the data parsed from the json files found in the github repo. For this to work a parser should be created, so the External Data extension is fed just the info from that given item/creature/etc, and not the whole json (which includes all the stuff from a category, which would confuse that extension). By using templates for the #get_web_data we could theoretically make every page data of a given category to automatically update as soon as the github json updates, show only the data of the last stable, or even offer two different versions for both the latest stable and the latest experimental. That means that once a page is created, you don't have to worry about it being updated anymore.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>For the updating of the remaining pages and sections (the task I mentioned above), I'm currently considering using <a class="external text" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MassEditRegex.html">this extension</a>. Although the resulting pages would more than likely still need to be revised, it'd make the updating to the current system somewhat easier (at least less time consuming).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I still need to contact GlyphGryph in any case. Those extensions should be installed, someone should have to get his/her hands dirty in some php and, maybe, the wiki to be updated to the latest release (currently using 1.19). But if all what I mention was to be implemented properly, we'd have a semiautomatic system that anyone could use, which would add new content and keep it updated just by writing the name of the new page in an input box, and without relying on dedicated bot or tech savvy users. I'll also propose him to create a new subforum solely dedicated to the wiki, so we can coordinate, exchange instructions and tips, and give or take feedback more easily. But, well, we'll see how this turns out.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I would like to know what you think of the browser and how we can work together to achieve the best user experience. --<a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User:Sheco&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User:Sheco (page does not exist)">Sheco</a></dd></dl>

<p>If you're still active, I have to ask that you put up a page on how to properly maintain and update it.  Been cleaning up and updating for the past couple weeks and have yet to untangle the mysteries of the "footers" templates among various other things.  Thank you.  --<a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User:NotaZombie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User:NotaZombie (page does not exist)">NotaZombie</a> (<a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User_talk:NotaZombie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User talk:NotaZombie (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:43, 28 August 2014 (PDT)
