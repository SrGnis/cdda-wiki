<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PRM_Faction:_Fungus">PRM Faction: Fungus</span></h2>
<pre> The Mycus, also known by the more common name, 'The Fungus', is a hive mind race of homogenous invaders and terminally infected victims.  The fungus does not expend energy trying to 'conquer' areas or organisms; instead it focuses the vast majority of its efforts trying to reproduce as much and fast as possible.  Defense and offense are largely limited to key organisms; typically those that can spread fungus the fastest or coordinate the fungal spread in a rather general manner.  Even the controlling members of the race exist only to aid the spread of the fungus, and those underneath it have even less individuality than the zombies do; being made of one material.  Only a handful of 'true' fungal monsters exist; the rest being victims controlled by the fungus.
</pre>
<p>In the core game, there are only 6 types of true fungal monster; the small fungal sprout, the mature fungaloid, the fungal queen, the fungal tower, the fungal bloom and the omnipresent fungal spore.  Although many creatures can be affected by the fungal infections, namely (n)pcs, ants, and zombies, the fungus deals outright damages any other organic life their spores touch.  Many fungal structures regularly eject spores, and most will explode into a cloud of spore upon death, leading to several of its attackers becoming fungal monsters or becoming infected.  This will often lead to a cycle of infection, where whole colonies of ill-prepared creatures will die or become fungal spawn.
This is the strength of the core game Mycus faction.  They spread by dying or being attacked, and even if left in peace, their spores will cover the ground and breed an armada of mindless spore spreaders.  Once one fungaloid exists in an area, it will propagate until the whole region is unlivable.
</p><p>In the <a href="./Pisskop%27s_Rebalancing_Mod.html" title="Pisskop's Rebalancing Mod">PRM mod</a>, the fungus retain much of this strategy.  There are currently only two new types of 'pure' fungus; the tender and the boil.  The fungal boils spawn fungal tenders, while the fungal tenders function as a more aggressive 'defense', injecting fungal spores into wildlife and hunting down disturbances.  Many creatures now have a fungal form, which will also attempt to use physical attacks to spread spores.  Fungus proliferation has expanded to such an extent that, although the fungus don't have much physical prowess on their own, they will amass hordes of infected defenders, such as fungal dionaea, fungal tardigrades, fungal shockers, fungal survivors, and even fungal marloss men.
The fungus in the mod is more insidious and subtle than in the core game, and they creep into areas with the help infected animals that migrate.  The fungus is a problem that, if left to grow, will become harder to root out with every passing second.  Even after the exsanguination of a fungal queen, the base fungaloids will continue to reproduce and continue to attack.  Every single monster must be purged to end a fungal threat, which unlike zombies, do not require new victims or combat to spread.  Fungus and infected creatures do not share the same faction, though they are not hostile to one another.
</p><p>Fungal strength lies in its insidiousness, how it creeps across the land almost as a function of time.  They do not need to fight, and are undoubtedly the weakest combatant of any faction of the game.  They can reproduce without their queen structures, and use native species to spread themselves by controlling the behavior of their still-living hosts.  Their death will eliminate huge threats to other fungal structures, and so are surprisingly some of the most secure encampments of the game.  Fungus is an ever-expanding threat, and when left alone and within the reality bubble for any length of time will grow to menace whole regions.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Roster">Roster</span></h2>
<p>The vast majority of the new fungal monsters are infected animals and humans, though a very limited degree of evolution can occur for specific creatures within the faction.  Being largely non-combative in nature, the fungal critters simply take longer to adapt to threats and are largely capable of smothering an area with microscopic spores.

<p>Fungal walls and hedgerows are defensive structures that provide a physical barrier against melee attack.  They also produce spores, although the hedgerow is equipped to defend its parent structure while the wall merely deters attackers while produce vastly more spores and boils.
</p><p>Neither is a huge threat in combat, but will increase the difficulty of killing a fungal structure.  They are both extremely flammable and will spawn so fast around the fireproof queens that they will create an eternal fire that will not self extinguish.  It is not recommended to use fire to clear the fungal patch around the queen if you want to melee or loot the area.

<p>The only changes to fungaloids are their levels of agression.  They have been transformed from 'completely passive' to 'merely passive' and given triggers about getting hurt and their faction getting attacked.  The fungal faction consists of 2 subfactions, the proper fungus and the infected monsters.  Infected monsters are considered 'neutral' by the fungus proper, however the infected will defend the fungus like normal.
</p><p>Still, fungaloids make very poor combatants.  They can soak damage, explode into spores upon death, and in numbers can wear down a survivor, but they can oly hear and smell, and will thus only drift towards the fighting.

<p>Fungal Ants are a little stronger than vanilla in PRM.  They spawn in groups and despite having almost no ability to sense hostiles will defend the fungus the best they can.  They make good target practice, although they are still contagious.  They will release spores upon death.
</p><p>Fants, the evolution of the fungal ant, is a still blind creature, but a much more potent blind creature.  Not really a factor in most engagements, they can completely miss out on a fight due to the fungal overgrowth.  That doesn't make them nonfactors, as monsters will continue to aggress towards fants.
</p><p><br/>
<b>Infected Zombies</b>
</p><p>Infected Zombies and Boomers are given more sight and slightly more spore-producing ability.  They are largely unchanged.  Boomers will produce small blobs upon death as well as spores though.

<p>Fungal boils are the progenator of fungal tenders.  They are densely packed spore clouds, and will on occassion plant themselves and become a fungaloid or explode into a pack of spores.  This latter is particularly devestating, and can wipe out lesser creatures.
</p><p>Fungal boils are slightly hostile, and will path towards targets in the hopes of covering them with spores.  They effectively have a timer, and are subject to the winds, meaning they are not the most mobile forces.
</p>
<pre> It is possible for an industrious survivor to 'incubate' boils as weapons, and they make pretty good weapons considering all monsters will either take massive amounts of true damage or convert into a (less threatening) fungal monster.

<p>Fungal tenders are the only proper non-spore fungus created by the mod.  Capable of tunneling under the gorund, they can sneak up to unsuspecting monsters using their senses, injecting them with spores and defending the colony by way of aggressive piercing attacks.  In addition to its uncommon stabbing damage (which can pierce weak armor) it also posesses a tentacle attack, which allows it to whip at targets from range, achieving an effective ambush.  It can even do so at night through a single hull tile, hitting a player sleeping inside a car with its flexable limbs.
</p><p>Not incredibly dangerous to even a mid-game survivor, the fungal tender nevertheless represents the fungus' interest in producing a stealthy attacker and screen against intruders.  And is a step towards making moderately infested areas less habitable to non-fungal players.

<p>Marloss Man, based off the original exploits of the forumite TheFlame52, is a human who has converted into a fungal queen by means of using the mild <i>spoiler</i> of  <a href="./Marloss_berry.html" title="Marloss berry">marloss</a>.  Being consider Post-Human, marloss man has little interest in talk, and is occupied with spreading and tending to whole fungal colonies.
</p><p>Marloss man spawns in neutral to everything, and grows increasingly agitated as combat occurs.  Marloss man's first line of attack is a machine gun fired from its shoulder; and yes it is lore that it can be this strong and steady.  If it should fail to kill its target with this, either because it used all its ammo or the target has closed, it is a very strong melee fighter, capable of dodging and even knocking over its opponent.  It still retains human-level intelligence, and will often ignore weak targets in favor of the more serious threat.
</p><p>The best thing you can do if you see marloss man is run the other way.  If you do manage to kill it, it drops its ammo and machine gun, and also some berries it uses as food.

<p>Fungal wildlife is native life that is in various stages of infection, from almost asymptomatic to bloated with sacs and spores.  They posess the abilities they had as healthy animals, at a diminished level, and usually some method of spreading their infection.  Their behavior is ackward and 'off', acting in manners the healthy version would be disinclined towards.  Sometimes infected animals can be found at times and locations that are not natural for it.
</p><p>Most of the animals are straightforeward in design, in that they do as you would expect.  The wolf is the most aggressive of the group, and because they spawn in packs can pose a threat to an unsuspecting survivor without armor.  They can cause decent pain before the player is aware of the danger they are in, especially if they are new to the mod and don't appreciate how much stabbing damage can hurt.
</p><p>The deer is a special case monster.  It can be incensed into hostility simply by the sound of a vehicle, and will sometime charge out of the forest and onto the road in pursuit of a car.  Being one of the fastest critters in the game, they can keep up with a car going less than 50mph/80kph, and will smash into the car as they chase, doing relatively minor damage.  As they close they may lunge into the player to knock them down and kick at them with their hooves before bursting into a cloud of viscera, wafting smoke, and spores.  Not the most pleasant monster, but easily to see dead.

<p>The tardigrade in the real world is a microscopic insect that is capable of surviving in the void of space.  Bulky and posessing claws for grasping and tentacles for perception, this little guy has like many insects grown to massive proportions after the blob invaded.
</p><p>A fungal tardigrade is an almost blind, still passive monster that is even more docile due to the fungus interrupting its perceptive abilities.  It will however, still defend the fungus when it can, and is capable of a limited ranged attack even when peaceful.  Don't engage these unless you have to or want the flesh.

<p>Fungal survivors are at the endstage of their lives.  Infected to the point of non-sentience, fungal survivors are far, far more likely to hang around in open fields and chase or amble after prey, punching and biting and kicking instead of using tools.  They have whatever armor they wear, and while not are durable or mindless as zombies, the comparison can certainly be made.

<p>Infected survivors are just that; survivors who are infected and no longer completely sane.  Their purpose within the game is to be an unpredictable element.  You shouldn't feel safe around them, because they have guns and 'odd' triggers.  They attack squirrels with firearms, and then look around to see who was laughing at them from across the map.  It is additionally not always worth killing them, as their equipment might be unusably weathered and they cause guilt.  However, they will often drop ammunition and magizines and guns, as well as holsters, melee weapons, armor, leather clothing, and even helmets and medicine.
</p><p>As stated above, they will make a lot of noise and have an unpredictable hostility.  Its a matter of inevitablity that they will go hostile, the real question is when, as unlike things like soldier ants or other low hostility stalking monsters they will not always do so in sight of you nor will they follow you.  They can shout and attract zombie hordes to the area and spread spores around.  They are often found hiding in tents or in caves, and wandering around in general; sometimes in groups.

<p>A fungalized shocker zombie, this zombie has a considerable speed bonus over other fungus and loses its electrical immunity.  It will often shock itself and its allies in an attempt to kill an intruder, but the Fungus does not particularly place value on individual life.

<p>Though many triffids produce specific anti-fungal spores to counter the Mycus, not all of them can resist the spread as it engulfs them.  These become subservient to the faction they are the strongest against.
</p><p>Fungal triffids are much like the their original triffid versions.  They are often very resistant to blunt trauma, and entirely have additionally had their abilities preverted to better serve the cause.  The fungal brood can spread spores almost as well as a lesser fungal blossom, and the fionaea is large enough to grow and plant fungal hedgerows, creating a 'fungal maze' that attacks anything that gets close.  Many can resist fire and acid in ways the fungus simply cannot, and these mid to late game monsters flesh out and flavor the relatively homogenous horde.

<p>Squigs, small, dog-piglike monsters from the warhammer franchise, are savage, incredibly stupid monsters spawned from fungus and kept as pets, livestock, and war animals.  They may be ridden or release in packs like dogs might be.
</p><p>Squigs in the PRM mod are fast, heavy hitting, and relentless in their attack.  They regenerate health as they fight, and can easily overwhelm a midgame survivor who cannt deal enough damage in melee, is improperly equipped, cannot stun, or uses range and fire incorrectly.  They can spawn in packs, which can overrun even those who can do the above.  Running is advisable in general.
