&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;'''Overmap''' is the world map, what you see when you hit the {{k|m}} key, it is essentially endless and can be limited only by external means. [[Character]] can see five tiles on the overmap in any direction, [[binoculars]] double that distance, but some structures still obstruct range of view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each overmap tile (e.g. house, crossroad, forest) equates to a single '''tinymap''', or 24x24 player-size tiles. Tinymap is not really used in the code much, but it is available because it is more efficient than a '''map'''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Map''' is 156x156 player-size tiles and used in normal gameplay; the game has a ''map m'', which is the area which is considered &amp;quot;in-play,&amp;quot; inside which [[monsters]], [[fields]], [[traps]], etc. will be processed. Other than their respective sizes, map and tinymap are completely identical&amp;lt;!--, and any function available to map is available to tinymap--&amp;gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both tinymap and map are formed of an array of '''submaps'''. A submap is 12x12 player-sized tiles, and also keeps track of any fields, items, traps, and computers in that area. Tinymap is made up of 2x2 submaps; map is made up of 13x13 submaps.&amp;lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You should never interface with the submap directly, unless you are adding something new for it to track.  map has several functions for accessing and/or modifying the contents of submap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The player is always in the center submap.  If they move off of it to the left, they are shifted to the right side of the center submap, and all the submaps get shifted to the right.  This creates the illusion of contiguous movement; think of it like a treadmill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Manipulating terrain data is easy.  Just use the map::ter(int x, int y) function (it is duplicated for tinymap).  It returns a reference to the terrain at point (x, y).  This reference is modifiable; so you could say m.ter(10, 10) = t_floor to turn the terrain at point (10, 10) to floor.--&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Chances are relative to each other; e.g. a 200 chance is twice as likely as a 100 chance to appear.&lt;br /&gt;

* Twisted metal, 250 movement cost, rough, sharp, can be cleared with a shovel, gives some chunks of steel and scrap metal&lt;br /&gt;
* Pile of rubble, 200 movement cost, rough (can cut up feet), diggable&lt;br /&gt;
* Grass, diggable 100 movement cost&lt;br /&gt;
* Dirt, diggable 100 movement cost&lt;br /&gt;
* Sidewalk, Pavement, 100 movement cost. Impassible for tunnelling monsters&lt;br /&gt;
* Mound of dirt, 150 movement cost. Often a sign of nearby mine fields. Can be cleaned up by digging a pit and filling it again.&lt;br /&gt;
* Mutated poppy flower, 150 movement cost. Examine to pick a flower. Has a chance to put you to sleep and cause damage as the flower grows into your legs, drops a poppy flower, and a poppy bud. Can crash your game while calculating the sleep period.&lt;br /&gt;
* Window frame, 400 movement cost, sharp. Lure monsters in this to slow them down and get a few attacks in. Might also damage them a little. Can be cleaned up using the construction menu.&lt;br /&gt;
* Shrub, 400 movement cost, smashable. Lure monsters in this to slow them down and get a few attacks in.&lt;br /&gt;
* Blueberry bush, 400 movement cost, smashable. Examine for a chance to find blueberries (might be rotten). Turns into a shrub after being picked.&lt;br /&gt;
* Locker, can be smashed into scrap metal and a pipe. Cannot be deconstructed.&lt;br /&gt;
* Bench, 150 movement cost, can be smashed for some 2 by 4's some nails and some broken wood. Can be deconstructed for more 2 by 4's and nails.&lt;br /&gt;
* Pile of ash, 100  movement cost, diggable. Remains after you burn stuff, like bushes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;
the above could of course use icons or mention the color, but what's missing is this: maybe there's a section for it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Floor, wood/blue - burns, buildable, supports the roof in outdoor buildings. to turn a white tile blue, start building floors from a corner. that's because floors are phase one of building a roof and you can't have a roof without the supporting walls.&lt;br /&gt;
* Floor, rock/white - does not burn. be sure to have your indoor fires surrounded by white floor tiles to avoid burning down your underground lair. there are no(?) surface buildings with white floor tiles because there would not be a roof over them. if you're underground and everything is blue around you, use a jackhammer to trash a section of wall so that you can build a fireplace into the surrounding rock.&lt;br /&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;46.115.82.184: /* Removing parts */  corrected where removed parts go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Vehicles, as their name suggests, provide a mean for the survivor to move around much faster than on foot and if equipped with a trunk or box; allow the survivor to store his or her belongings in them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately due to the loud noises their engines make, they can quickly turn into a death-trap should you cruise through a town because of the huge amount of zombies their loudness attracts. Because of acid rains and perhaps the neglect of their previous owners, most of the vehicles found in the streets are either damaged or broken, and this fact can quickly lead to the demise to the unlucky-enough driver of the car should his or her car break down in the middle of a horde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Common Locations ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Automobiles and other kinds of vehicles can be found in many places, such as car lots, garages, and some other places. It will be much more likely for a vehicle to spawn in a car lot than a garage, though, and it is necessary to note that the chances of finding a broken vehicle are higher than a working one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing you want to check when finding a new vehicle is the amount of gasoline or batteries left (unless it's a bicycle) and if it has enough wheels to move around. That information is displayed when {{key|e}}xamining the vehicle. With enough fuel and wheels you can start driving that vehicle as soon as you find it, so you can move it to a safer place to be able to enhance it, repair it, refill it, etc without the threat of zombies and other beasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Default Vehicles ==&lt;br /&gt;
This is a list of vehicles that you can find in the aforementioned locations:&lt;br /&gt;
* Car&lt;br /&gt;
* Beetle&lt;br /&gt;
* Motorcycle&lt;br /&gt;
* Scooter&lt;br /&gt;
* Bicycle&lt;br /&gt;
* Quad Bike&lt;br /&gt;
* Semi Truck&lt;br /&gt;
* Truck Trailer&lt;br /&gt;
* Flatbed Truck&lt;br /&gt;
* School bus&lt;br /&gt;
* Wagon&lt;br /&gt;
* Bubble Car&lt;br /&gt;
* Golf Cart&lt;br /&gt;
* Military Cargo Truck&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can also find incomplete versions of some of those vehicles inside garages. In that case they'll be displayed as &amp;quot;&amp;lt;name of vehicle&amp;gt; Chassis&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Driving vehicles ==&lt;br /&gt;
Any character can drive a vehicle independently of his/her driving skill, although the lower the skill is the higher the chance of losing control of the vehicle while driving it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can drive a vehicle by moving over a vehicle tile with both a seat and vehicle controls present. To exit a vehicle press {{key|e}}. Boarding and unboarding costs 200 [[movement points]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To control a vehicle you can use either the cursor keys or the numeric pad. Using the numeric pad has the advantage of allowing your vehicle to move forward without any other interaction than pressing {{key|5}} (or {{key|.}}) once your vehicle is in motion. Otherwise you'll need to either turn or increase/decrease your speed to update the current vehicle position. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To the left of the speed indicator is the skidding display. If the display shows {{igs|.0.|c_green}}, then the wheels are facing the same direction in which the vehicle is moving. If the display shows {{igs|L..|c_red}} or {{igs|..R|c_red}}, then the vehicle moves to the left or right of the direction it is facing. Try to turn to restore control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles have a built-in cruise control device (accessed via {{key|$}}) which allows you to set the desired speed. That will make your vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to match the one you set. When this device is deactivated the vehicle will progressively lose speed unless you increase it manually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The {{key|$}} menu also allows you to turn on and off your vehicle's head lights, if they are installed and still functional, and activate and deactivate any installed turret.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting out of a moving vehicle (with a speed other than 0) will damage you. The damage is proportional to the current speed of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Press {{key|s}} to use the handbrake. The handbrake is intended to bring the vehicle to a standstill, but if the vehicle is unstable (if it turned recently, for example), it can cause a skid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the vehicle is moving, you cannot perform some actions (sleeping, [[Books|reading]], [[construction]]). To perform these actions, the vehicle must be stopped and the character must disembark. Note that seats are almost as comfortable as beds when it comes to sleeping in a vehicle, making the typical vehicle a good place to spend the night. [[One-handed]] firearms can be used while driving a vehicle, although a penalty to accuracy (in the form of a constant addition to recoil) is suffered, with its severity depending on the speed of the vehicle. This penalty is reduced with a higher Driving skill. Non-obstructive parts of the vehicle, such as wheels, can only be hit by bullets if deliberately aimed at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Light and, particularly, two wheeled vehicles are better suited to road types of terrain. In other types you have a chance of crashing against bushes and other natural obstacles if your speed is too low. This will stop your vehicle dead and, in some cases, throw you into the air (and take damage once you collide). You can also risk getting your vehicle stuck between obstacles, making its recovery extremely tricky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle Construction ==&lt;br /&gt;
While it is certainly possible to build your own vehicle, a great amount of materials are needed as well as the following tools:&lt;br /&gt;
*A powered welder or [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]&lt;br /&gt;
*A wrench or [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]&lt;br /&gt;
*A hacksaw (if removing parts)&lt;br /&gt;
In order to create a vehicle, in addition to the above tools, a steel frame is required for starting the process. (Access the construction menu {{key|*}} and select 'Start Vehicle Construction'.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A functioning vehicle requires a minimum of:&lt;br /&gt;
*Two wheels&lt;br /&gt;
*One seat&lt;br /&gt;
*Controls&lt;br /&gt;
*Any Engine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note, that removing initial steel frame is impossible until you remove all other parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many different vehicle designs can be created and optional accessories such as turrets and headlights can also be added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles consist of parts, which can be damaged and, eventually, broken. Parts can be external, or internal (which are mounted inside the former). External parts are enclosed in {{igs|[|c_ltgray}}{{igs|square brackets|c_green}}{{igs|]|c_ltgray}}, internal parts in {{igs|-|c_ltgray}}{{igs|dashes|c_green}}{{igs|-|c_ltgray}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internal parts which are tagged as 'over' are a special case. They will be enclosed in {{igs|(|c_ltgray}}{{igs|round brackets|c_green}}{{igs|)|c_ltgray}}, override the color of the external part, and will function as armor — protecting other parts in this tile from damage (although not infallibly).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicle tiles can be tagged as inside (marked as '''{{igs|In|c_ltgray}}''') or outside ({{igs|Out|c_ltgray}}). Inside tiles protect from [[weather]] effects, while outside ones don't. To become an inside tile the tile must have a roof, and the adjacent tiles must have either roof or some impenetrable obstacle (like a closed door or windshield).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The mass, top and safe speed, acceleration, fuel consumption, noise and mobility of a vehicle is based on its composition. For example, safe speed is the speed at which engine can pull the mass easily. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can also install multiple engines in a single vehicle, but you need pretty high mechanics skill to install more than one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Modifying a vehicle ==&lt;br /&gt;
You can modify your vehicle as long as you have the required components, mechanics skill and tools (loaded [[Tools#welder|welder]], wrench, a hack saw, or just an [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Characters will refuse to modify a vehicle if their [[morale]] is lower than -50.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Removing parts ===&lt;br /&gt;
Select the part you want to remove (by using the cursor keys) and r{{key|e}}move it. You'll need a [[Items#wrench|wrench]] and [[Items#hack saw|hack saw]] (or just an [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]) in your inventory or nearby to do this. The removed components will be dropped on the ground, under the player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Successfully removing a part grants 30&amp;lt;!--2 * 5 + 20--&amp;gt; skill points to the mechanics [[Skills|skill]]. If a trunk with items inside is removed, the items will be placed under the player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Installing parts ===&lt;br /&gt;
Select the area where you want to install something by using the cursor keys and then {{key|i}}nstall it. A list of possible accessories will be displayed in the lower right area. Navigate the list until you find the one you want and press {{key|RETURN}}. Those greyed out are possible installations where you lack the required components.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New parts can be added only to passable non-diagonal adjacent squares. A successful installation grants [part difficulty] * 5 + 20 practice points to the mechanics [[Skills|skill]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Available parts ====&lt;br /&gt;
'''&amp;quot;Par&amp;quot;:'''&lt;br /&gt;
* ''power'' for engines (top speed) and solar panel (% of 1 fuel per turn, can be &amp;gt; 100)&lt;br /&gt;
* ''size'' for wheels, fuel tanks, and trunks&lt;br /&gt;
* ''bonus'' for seatbelt (str) and muffler (%)&lt;br /&gt;
Steel [[Items#steel frame|frame]], [[Items#steel plating|plating]], as well as [[Items#spiked plating|spiked]] and [[Items#hard plating|hard]] plating can be [[Crafting|craft]]ed with a welder by using lumps and chunks of steel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turrets fire automatically at enemies as long as they have ammo. They can shoot at your own car.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle Damage ==&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles are damaged by colliding against obstacles, by environmental damage (such as acid rain and fire), by the type of terrain you're driving over or just by simple use. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As in real life, the damage suffered by your vehicle is locational. For example, by crashing the front right part of your vehicle against a building you would damage only the front right wheel, front right frame, and any accessories located in that area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the current speed exceeds the indicated safe speed (which you can check by {{key|e}}xamining your vehicle), the chance to damage the engine grows. You'll know if you're exceeding it if the current speed display turns yellow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that you can still drive a vehicle with more than two wheels (such as a car) even if some of them are broken or missing. You can check its mobility status by {{key|e}}xamining it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The damage of each part is displayed using a color code, from undamaged to broken:&lt;br /&gt;
* Dark green&lt;br /&gt;
* Green&lt;br /&gt;
* Light green&lt;br /&gt;
* Yellow&lt;br /&gt;
* Pink &lt;br /&gt;
* Red&lt;br /&gt;
* Grey&lt;br /&gt;
A part will keep being functional until it's grey, which indicates that it's broken and needs a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle Repairs ==&lt;br /&gt;
To repair a vehicle you need a loaded welder and a wrench (either in your inventory or nearby) or an [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]], then {{key|e}}xamine the vehicle and select the part you want to repair by pressing the cursor keys. Once the part is selected you'll be able to {{key|r}}epair it if your mechanics skill is equal or higher than the one required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a part is colored grey it means that it's broken and you'll need the specified spare part (in your inventory or nearby) in order to repair it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finishing a repair grants [part difficulty + 2] * 5 + 20 practice points to mechanics [[skills|skill]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Refilling a vehicle ==&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles except bicycles need some sort of combustible or power source in order to move. You can check how filled its gasoline tank or batteries are by looking at the fuel indicator. It's displayed as &amp;quot;E../F&amp;quot;, where the slash indicates how Empty or Full the gas tank or batteries are (close to E, empty, close to F, full). While mounted you can check it on the lower right corner of the screen. While dismounted you have to {{key|e}}xamine the vehicle to check it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Gasoline engines ===&lt;br /&gt;
Gasoline can be found in gas stations and some mines and can be used to fill the gas tank of your vehicle in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''A)''' {{key|e}}xamine  a gas pump. When prompted say {{key|Y}}es to start pumping and then {{key|N}}o when asked if you want to pour it on the ground, then choose any empty container in your possession that is able to hold liquids. You can use anything for this purpose, from a plastic bottle (that only holds 400 units) to a plastic jerrycan (which can hold up to 8000 units of gasoline). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a recipient filled with gasoline {{key|e}}xamine your vehicle and search for its gasoline tank. You can find the tank by moving around the vehicle parts by using the cursor keys. Finally Re{{key|f}}ill it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''B)''' Move your vehicle next to the gas pump and {{key|e}}xamine it. When asked if you want to fill your vehicle say {{key|Y}}es, and then press the direction where your vehicle is. Now you can either say {{key|Y}}es to automatically refill the vehicle until its gas tank is full or say {{key|N}}o and only fill it a bit. Whatever you decide depends on the situation, as filling a tank from empty to full can take a long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Electric engines ===&lt;br /&gt;
Require batteries and/or solar panels installed.&lt;br /&gt;
Much more silent. &lt;br /&gt;
Sound not affected by muffler.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Using Vehicle Storage ==&lt;br /&gt;
Stand next to the tile with Vehicle Storage and {{key|D}}rop items into it. This has to be done before you can {{key|e}}xamine the tile to see or use what's there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can store items in any seat, bed, box or trunk present in the vehicle. From all those, trunks are the ones with higher storage capacity. While you can use the driver's seat for storage you won't be able to sit properly to drive your vehicle if it's too packed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the part used for storage has reached its maximum capacity any further items you place there will be dropped on the ground (you'll be warned about it). To recover those objects you have to {{key|e}}xamine the storage area and say {{key|N}}o when prompted. Remember that if you don't pick those objects up again they'll be left lying there once you drive away.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Vehicles, as their name suggests, provide a mean for the survivor to move around much faster than on foot and if equipped with a trunk or box; allow the survivor to store his or her belongings in them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately due to the loud noises their engines make, they can quickly turn into a death-trap should you cruise through a town because of the huge amount of zombies their loudness attracts. Because of acid rains and perhaps the neglect of their previous owners, most of the vehicles found in the streets are either damaged or broken, and this fact can quickly lead to the demise to the unlucky-enough driver of the car should his or her car break down in the middle of a horde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Common Locations ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Automobiles and other kinds of vehicles can be found in many places, such as car lots, garages, and some other places. It will be much more likely for a vehicle to spawn in a car lot than a garage, though, and it is necessary to note that the chances of finding a broken vehicle are higher than a working one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing you want to check when finding a new vehicle is the amount of gasoline or batteries left (unless it's a bicycle) and if it has enough wheels to move around. That information is displayed when {{key|e}}xamining the vehicle. With enough fuel and wheels you can start driving that vehicle as soon as you find it, so you can move it to a safer place to be able to enhance it, repair it, refill it, etc without the threat of zombies and other beasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Default Vehicles ==&lt;br /&gt;
This is a list of vehicles that you can find in the aforementioned locations:&lt;br /&gt;
* Car&lt;br /&gt;
* Beetle&lt;br /&gt;
* Motorcycle&lt;br /&gt;
* Scooter&lt;br /&gt;
* Bicycle&lt;br /&gt;
* Quad Bike&lt;br /&gt;
* Semi Truck&lt;br /&gt;
* Truck Trailer&lt;br /&gt;
* Flatbed Truck&lt;br /&gt;
* School bus&lt;br /&gt;
* Wagon&lt;br /&gt;
* Bubble Car&lt;br /&gt;
* Golf Cart&lt;br /&gt;
* Military Cargo Truck&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can also find incomplete versions of some of those vehicles inside garages. In that case they'll be displayed as &amp;quot;&amp;lt;name of vehicle&amp;gt; Chassis&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Driving vehicles ==&lt;br /&gt;
Any character can drive a vehicle independently of his/her driving skill, although the lower the skill is the higher the chance of losing control of the vehicle while driving it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can drive a vehicle by moving over a vehicle tile with both a seat and vehicle controls present. To exit a vehicle press {{key|e}}. Boarding and unboarding costs 200 [[movement points]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To control a vehicle you can use either the cursor keys or the numeric pad. Using the numeric pad has the advantage of allowing your vehicle to move forward without any other interaction than pressing {{key|5}} (or {{key|.}}) once your vehicle is in motion. Otherwise you'll need to either turn or increase/decrease your speed to update the current vehicle position. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To the left of the speed indicator is the skidding display. If the display shows {{igs|.0.|c_green}}, then the wheels are facing the same direction in which the vehicle is moving. If the display shows {{igs|L..|c_red}} or {{igs|..R|c_red}}, then the vehicle moves to the left or right of the direction it is facing. Try to turn to restore control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles have a built-in cruise control device (accessed via {{key|$}}) which allows you to set the desired speed. That will make your vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to match the one you set. When this device is deactivated the vehicle will progressively lose speed unless you increase it manually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The {{key|$}} menu also allows you to turn on and off your vehicle's head lights, if they are installed and still functional, and activate and deactivate any installed turret.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting out of a moving vehicle (with a speed other than 0) will damage you. The damage is proportional to the current speed of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Press {{key|s}} to use the handbrake. The handbrake is intended to bring the vehicle to a standstill, but if the vehicle is unstable (if it turned recently, for example), it can cause a skid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the vehicle is moving, you cannot perform some actions (sleeping, [[Books|reading]], [[construction]]). To perform these actions, the vehicle must be stopped and the character must disembark. Note that seats are almost as comfortable as beds when it comes to sleeping in a vehicle, making the typical vehicle a good place to spend the night. [[One-handed]] firearms can be used while driving a vehicle, although a penalty to accuracy (in the form of a constant addition to recoil) is suffered, with its severity depending on the speed of the vehicle. This penalty is reduced with a higher Driving skill. Non-obstructive parts of the vehicle, such as wheels, can only be hit by bullets if deliberately aimed at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Light and, particularly, two wheeled vehicles are better suited to road types of terrain. In other types you have a chance of crashing against bushes and other natural obstacles if your speed is too low. This will stop your vehicle dead and, in some cases, throw you into the air (and take damage once you collide). You can also risk getting your vehicle stuck between obstacles, making its recovery extremely tricky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle Construction ==&lt;br /&gt;
While it is certainly possible to build your own vehicle, a great amount of materials are needed as well as the following tools:&lt;br /&gt;
*A powered welder or [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]&lt;br /&gt;
*A wrench or [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]&lt;br /&gt;
*A hacksaw (if removing parts)&lt;br /&gt;
In order to create a vehicle, in addition to the above tools, a steel frame is required for starting the process. (Access the construction menu {{key|*}} and select 'Start Vehicle Construction'.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A functioning vehicle requires a minimum of:&lt;br /&gt;
*Two wheels&lt;br /&gt;
*One seat&lt;br /&gt;
*Controls&lt;br /&gt;
*Any Engine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note, that removing initial steel frame is impossible until you remove all other parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many different vehicle designs can be created and optional accessories such as turrets and headlights can also be added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles consist of parts, which can be damaged and, eventually, broken. Parts can be external, or internal (which are mounted inside the former). External parts are enclosed in {{igs|[|c_ltgray}}{{igs|square brackets|c_green}}{{igs|]|c_ltgray}}, internal parts in {{igs|-|c_ltgray}}{{igs|dashes|c_green}}{{igs|-|c_ltgray}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internal parts which are tagged as 'over' are a special case. They will be enclosed in {{igs|(|c_ltgray}}{{igs|round brackets|c_green}}{{igs|)|c_ltgray}}, override the color of the external part, and will function as armor — protecting other parts in this tile from damage (although not infallibly).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicle tiles can be tagged as inside (marked as '''{{igs|In|c_ltgray}}''') or outside ({{igs|Out|c_ltgray}}). Inside tiles protect from [[weather]] effects, while outside ones don't. To become an inside tile the tile must have a roof, and the adjacent tiles must have either roof or some impenetrable obstacle (like a closed door or windshield).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The mass, top and safe speed, acceleration, fuel consumption, noise and mobility of a vehicle is based on its composition. For example, safe speed is the speed at which engine can pull the mass easily. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can also install multiple engines in a single vehicle, but you need pretty high mechanics skill to install more than one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Modifying a vehicle ==&lt;br /&gt;
You can modify your vehicle as long as you have the required components, mechanics skill and tools (loaded [[Tools#welder|welder]], wrench, a hack saw, or just an [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Characters will refuse to modify a vehicle if their [[morale]] is lower than -50.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Removing parts ===&lt;br /&gt;
Select the part you want to remove (by using the cursor keys) and r{{key|e}}move it. You'll need a [[Items#wrench|wrench]] and [[Items#hack saw|hack saw]] (or just an [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]]) in your inventory or nearby to do this. The removed components will be dropped on the ground, in a tile close to the area the part was removed from.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Successfully removing a part grants 30&amp;lt;!--2 * 5 + 20--&amp;gt; skill points to the mechanics [[Skills|skill]]. If a trunk with items inside is removed, the items will be placed under the player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Installing parts ===&lt;br /&gt;
Select the area where you want to install something by using the cursor keys and then {{key|i}}nstall it. A list of possible accessories will be displayed in the lower right area. Navigate the list until you find the one you want and press {{key|RETURN}}. Those greyed out are possible installations where you lack the required components.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New parts can be added only to passable non-diagonal adjacent squares. A successful installation grants [part difficulty] * 5 + 20 practice points to the mechanics [[Skills|skill]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Available parts ====&lt;br /&gt;
'''&amp;quot;Par&amp;quot;:'''&lt;br /&gt;
* ''power'' for engines (top speed) and solar panel (% of 1 fuel per turn, can be &amp;gt; 100)&lt;br /&gt;
* ''size'' for wheels, fuel tanks, and trunks&lt;br /&gt;
* ''bonus'' for seatbelt (str) and muffler (%)&lt;br /&gt;
Steel [[Items#steel frame|frame]], [[Items#steel plating|plating]], as well as [[Items#spiked plating|spiked]] and [[Items#hard plating|hard]] plating can be [[Crafting|craft]]ed with a welder by using lumps and chunks of steel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turrets fire automatically at enemies as long as they have ammo. They can shoot at your own car.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle Damage ==&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles are damaged by colliding against obstacles, by environmental damage (such as acid rain and fire), by the type of terrain you're driving over or just by simple use. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As in real life, the damage suffered by your vehicle is locational. For example, by crashing the front right part of your vehicle against a building you would damage only the front right wheel, front right frame, and any accessories located in that area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the current speed exceeds the indicated safe speed (which you can check by {{key|e}}xamining your vehicle), the chance to damage the engine grows. You'll know if you're exceeding it if the current speed display turns yellow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that you can still drive a vehicle with more than two wheels (such as a car) even if some of them are broken or missing. You can check its mobility status by {{key|e}}xamining it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The damage of each part is displayed using a color code, from undamaged to broken:&lt;br /&gt;
* Dark green&lt;br /&gt;
* Green&lt;br /&gt;
* Light green&lt;br /&gt;
* Yellow&lt;br /&gt;
* Pink &lt;br /&gt;
* Red&lt;br /&gt;
* Grey&lt;br /&gt;
A part will keep being functional until it's grey, which indicates that it's broken and needs a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle Repairs ==&lt;br /&gt;
To repair a vehicle you need a loaded welder and a wrench (either in your inventory or nearby) or an [[Integrated_Toolset|integrated toolset]], then {{key|e}}xamine the vehicle and select the part you want to repair by pressing the cursor keys. Once the part is selected you'll be able to {{key|r}}epair it if your mechanics skill is equal or higher than the one required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a part is colored grey it means that it's broken and you'll need the specified spare part (in your inventory or nearby) in order to repair it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finishing a repair grants [part difficulty + 2] * 5 + 20 practice points to mechanics [[skills|skill]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Refilling a vehicle ==&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles except bicycles need some sort of combustible or power source in order to move. You can check how filled its gasoline tank or batteries are by looking at the fuel indicator. It's displayed as &amp;quot;E../F&amp;quot;, where the slash indicates how Empty or Full the gas tank or batteries are (close to E, empty, close to F, full). While mounted you can check it on the lower right corner of the screen. While dismounted you have to {{key|e}}xamine the vehicle to check it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Gasoline engines ===&lt;br /&gt;
Gasoline can be found in gas stations and some mines and can be used to fill the gas tank of your vehicle in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''A)''' {{key|e}}xamine  a gas pump. When prompted say {{key|Y}}es to start pumping and then {{key|N}}o when asked if you want to pour it on the ground, then choose any empty container in your possession that is able to hold liquids. You can use anything for this purpose, from a plastic bottle (that only holds 400 units) to a plastic jerrycan (which can hold up to 8000 units of gasoline). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a recipient filled with gasoline {{key|e}}xamine your vehicle and search for its gasoline tank. You can find the tank by moving around the vehicle parts by using the cursor keys. Finally Re{{key|f}}ill it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''B)''' Move your vehicle next to the gas pump and {{key|e}}xamine it. When asked if you want to fill your vehicle say {{key|Y}}es, and then press the direction where your vehicle is. Now you can either say {{key|Y}}es to automatically refill the vehicle until its gas tank is full or say {{key|N}}o and only fill it a bit. Whatever you decide depends on the situation, as filling a tank from empty to full can take a long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Electric engines ===&lt;br /&gt;
Require batteries and/or solar panels installed.&lt;br /&gt;
Much more silent. &lt;br /&gt;
Sound not affected by muffler.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Using Vehicle Storage ==&lt;br /&gt;
Stand next to the tile with Vehicle Storage and {{key|D}}rop items into it. This has to be done before you can {{key|e}}xamine the tile to see or use what's there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can store items in any seat, bed, box or trunk present in the vehicle. From all those, trunks are the ones with higher storage capacity. While you can use the driver's seat for storage you won't be able to sit properly to drive your vehicle if it's too packed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the part used for storage has reached its maximum capacity any further items you place there will be dropped on the ground (you'll be warned about it). To recover those objects you have to {{key|e}}xamine the storage area and say {{key|N}}o when prompted. Remember that if you don't pick those objects up again they'll be left lying there once you drive away.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Tools are your friends, many of them have their own unique functions and most are needed in some [[crafting recipes]] and [[construction]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Tools with their own function ==&lt;br /&gt;
These tools can be {{key|a}}pplied and each one has specific uses that can help you survive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Crowbar - your best friend. Will quietly open all glass and wooden doors that are locked, not causing alarms to go off on certain [[buildings]]. Also lifts manholes and has a decent bash rating - though the hammer is quicker and has higher bash, the hammer can't pry open doors. As well can used to remove boarding from windows and doors.&lt;br /&gt;
* Fire extinguisher - bulky and heavy, but great against small to moderate sized fires. Blazes and bonfires are hard to keep under control with this tool. {{key|a}}pplying it will prompt you to choose a direction to spray in.&lt;br /&gt;
* Flashlight - {{key|a}}pplying it turns it on, increasing visible tiles in the dark by a large amount. Attracts a crowd, but useful in the dark. Don't forget to turn it off when you don't need it anymore! Deconstructs into 100 batteries, amplifier circuit, 4 scrap metal, 10 copper wire.&lt;br /&gt;
* Geiger Counter (&amp;quot;geiger ctr&amp;quot; ingame) - will make constant clicking noises when radiation is present. You can choose to scan yourself or the surrounding tiles.  Useful if you have iodine on-hand to cure radiation.  Those already mutated by radiation will need purifier or [[royal jelly]].&lt;br /&gt;
* Hoe, used to create mounds of dirt. Mounds have a little higher than normal movement penalty (150).&lt;br /&gt;
* Hammer - you can {{key|a}}pply this to remove boarding from windows and doors (500 [[moving points]]). Along with nails and two by fours, this is used during construction.  Also make for a very powerful weapon, and aids when {{key|s}}mashing down doors or windows.&lt;br /&gt;
* Light Amp Goggles - Like the flashlight, but its more stealthy and requires a UPS to operate. Tints everything green.&lt;br /&gt;
* Lighter - a common, but useful item to have in your inventory. Takes up no space and has enough charges for a game's worth, these are one of the more convenient tools you can find. {{key|a}}pplying it will prompt you to choose a direction in which to light something. Also necessary for some items such as [[marijuana]] and molotov cocktails.&lt;br /&gt;
* Mop - Allows you to clean up spills.&lt;br /&gt;
* mp3 player - lets you listen to sweet tunes and increases your morale, if you can afford the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
* Portal generator - creates a single portal in a nearby location. You may safely step to this portal, it does currently nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
* Radio - turning it on causes it to blare an annoying emergency broadcast. Attracts a crowd and so far only useful to scrap for amp circuits. In the future, it will broadcast hails from close factions.&lt;br /&gt;
* Sewing Kit - quite commonly found in houses, these are necessary for repairing and [[crafting recipes|sew]] [[clothing]]. Make sure you have a high enough tailoring ability though! Comes with 50 charges, depending on your [[skill]], you'll use a proportionate amount of string and the potential risk of failure. Low skill can damage clothing! Uses thread as charges.&lt;br /&gt;
* Scissors - used to cut cotton based clothing into rags and ropes into strings. Unlimited charges, tailoring skill for more rags.&lt;br /&gt;
* Spray Can - can be used to spray graffiti on the floor by {{key|a}}pplying it on the desired location.&lt;br /&gt;
* Tazer - uses batteries to stun enemies. Needs batteries, can me used from inventory. Uses 100 batteries at once.&lt;br /&gt;
* Teleporter - if you are lucky, you might find a few in Labs or in a pile of corpses. {{key|a}}pplying it will teleport you a short distance away from you current position. Useful when in a pinch, but extremely dangerous to use underground. Teleporting into solid rock is not good.&lt;br /&gt;
* Two-Way Radio - most useful for contacting a faction for help. Most of the time they will send you a helpful NPC to accompany you in your travels.  (NPCs are a bit broken right now, don't rely on them.)&lt;br /&gt;
* Water Purifier - Nice to have if you aren't sure if you are drinking clean water. Food poisoning is nasty when 'Z's are around. If you {{key|a}}pply this to stacked items it purifies entire containers, but only one container at a time. (The difference between dirty and clean water will ensure that you don't double-purify, and that you don't drink dirty water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Functions shared by tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Knives, Lawnmower blades, etc - All these bladed implements can be used to cut up fabric, and carve pieces of wood into skewers.&lt;br /&gt;
* Steak knives and butcher knives can butcher corpses. Stand over a corpse and {{key|B}}butcher it. Using a butcher knive provides more meat, and is quicker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== List of tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Reloading time''' of tools is a sum of their weight and volume plus 100 additional moving points and [[Clothing#Hands|hands encumberment penalty]]. Reloading is interruptable activity.&lt;br /&gt;
** '''Unloading time''' is a half of reloading time, and full charge is unloaded in one action. Unloading is non-interruptable activity.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Use''' — how many charges are used up when {{key|a}}pplying the object.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''SEC''' — how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is active; generally only used in the &amp;quot;whatever (on)&amp;quot; forms.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Revert''' — the item type that the tool will revert to once its charges are drained&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Funct.''' — a function called when the tool is {{key|a}}pplied, or called once per turn if the tool is active.  The same function can be used for both.  See [https://github.com/TheDarklingWolf/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/iuse.h iuse.h] and [https://github.com/TheDarklingWolf/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/iuse.cpp iuse.cpp] for functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;
/* TOOLS&lt;br /&gt;
 * MAX is the maximum number of charges help.&lt;br /&gt;
 * DEF is the default number of charges--items will be generated with this&lt;br /&gt;
 *  many charges.&lt;br /&gt;
 * USE is how many charges are used up when {{key|a}}pplying the object.&lt;br /&gt;
 * SEC is how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is&lt;br /&gt;
 *  active; generally only used in the &amp;quot;&amp;lt;whatever&amp;gt; (on)&amp;quot; forms&lt;br /&gt;
 * FUEL is the type of charge the tool uses; set to AT_NULL if the item is&lt;br /&gt;
 *  unable to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;
 * REVERT is the item type that the tool will revert to once its charges are&lt;br /&gt;
 *  drained&lt;br /&gt;
 * FUNCTION is a function called when the tool is {{key|a}}pplied, or called once per&lt;br /&gt;
 *  turn if the tool is active.  The same function can be used for both.  See&lt;br /&gt;
 *  iuse.h and iuse.cpp for functions.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Tools are your friends, many of them have their own unique functions and most are needed in some [[crafting recipes]] and [[construction]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Tools with their own function ==&lt;br /&gt;
These tools can be {{key|a}}pplied and each one has specific uses that can help you survive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Crowbar - your best friend. Will quietly open all glass and wooden doors that are locked, not causing alarms to go off on certain [[buildings]]. Also lifts manholes and has a decent bash rating - though the hammer is quicker and has higher bash, the hammer can't pry open doors. As well can used to remove boarding from windows and doors.&lt;br /&gt;
* Fire extinguisher - bulky and heavy, but great against small to moderate sized fires. Blazes and bonfires are hard to keep under control with this tool. {{key|a}}pplying it will prompt you to choose a direction to spray in.&lt;br /&gt;
* Flashlight - {{key|a}}pplying it turns it on, increasing visible tiles in the dark by a large amount. Attracts a crowd, but useful in the dark. Don't forget to turn it off when you don't need it anymore! Deconstructs into 100 batteries, amplifier circuit, 4 scrap metal, 10 copper wire.&lt;br /&gt;
* Geiger Counter (&amp;quot;geiger ctr&amp;quot; ingame) - will make constant clicking noises when radiation is present. You can choose to scan yourself or the surrounding tiles.  Useful if you have iodine on-hand to cure radiation.  Those already mutated by radiation will need purifier or [[royal jelly]].&lt;br /&gt;
* Hoe, used to create mounds of dirt. Mounds have a little higher than normal movement penalty (150).&lt;br /&gt;
* Hammer - you can {{key|a}}pply this to remove boarding from windows and doors (500 [[moving points]]). Along with nails and two by fours, this is used during construction.  Also make for a very powerful weapon, and aids when {{key|s}}mashing down doors or windows.&lt;br /&gt;
* Light Amp Goggles - Like the flashlight, but its more stealthy and requires a UPS to operate. Tints everything green.&lt;br /&gt;
* Lighter - a common, but useful item to have in your inventory. Takes up no space and has enough charges for a game's worth, these are one of the more convenient tools you can find. {{key|a}}pplying it will prompt you to choose a direction in which to light something. Also necessary for some items such as [[marijuana]] and molotov cocktails.&lt;br /&gt;
* Mop - Allows you to clean up spills.&lt;br /&gt;
* mp3 player - lets you listen to sweet tunes and increases your morale, if you can afford the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
* Portal generator - creates a single portal in a nearby location. You may safely step to this portal, it does currently nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
* Radio - turning it on causes it to blare an annoying emergency broadcast. Attracts a crowd and so far only useful to scrap for amp circuits. In the future, it will broadcast hails from close factions.&lt;br /&gt;
* Sewing Kit - quite commonly found in houses, these are necessary for repairing and [[crafting recipes|sew]] [[clothing]]. Make sure you have a high enough tailoring ability though! Comes with 50 charges, depending on your [[skill]], you'll use a proportionate amount of string and the potential risk of failure. Low skill can damage clothing! Uses thread as charges.&lt;br /&gt;
* Scissors - used to cut cotton based clothing into rags and ropes into strings. Unlimited charges, tailoring skill for more rags.&lt;br /&gt;
* Spray Can - can be used to spray graffiti on the floor by {{key|a}}pplying it on the desired location.&lt;br /&gt;
* Tazer - uses batteries to stun enemies. Needs batteries, can me used from inventory. Uses 100 batteries at once.&lt;br /&gt;
* Teleporter - if you are lucky, you might find a few in Labs or in a pile of corpses. {{key|a}}pplying it will teleport you a short distance away from you current position. Useful when in a pinch, but extremely dangerous to use underground. Teleporting into solid rock is not good.&lt;br /&gt;
* Two-Way Radio - most useful for contacting a faction for help. Most of the time they will send you a helpful NPC to accompany you in your travels.  (NPCs are a bit broken right now, don't rely on them.)&lt;br /&gt;
* Water Purifier - Nice to have if you aren't sure if you are drinking clean water. Food poisoning is nasty when 'Z's are around. If you {{key|a}}pply this to stacked items it purifies entire containers, but only one container at a time. (The difference between dirty and clean water will ensure that you don't double-purify, and that you don't drink dirty water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Functions shared by tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Knives, Lawnmower blades, etc - All these bladed implements can be used to cut up fabric, and carve pieces of wood into skewers.&lt;br /&gt;
* Steak knives and butcher knives can butcher corpses. Stand over a corpse and {{key|B}}butcher it. Using a butcher knive provides more meat, and is quicker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== List of tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Reloading time''' of tools is a sum of their weight and volume plus 100 additional moving points and [[Clothing#Hands|hands encumberment penalty]]. Reloading is interruptable activity.&lt;br /&gt;
** '''Unloading time''' is a half of reloading time, and full charge is unloaded in one action. Unloading is non-interruptable activity.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Use''' — how many charges are used up when {{key|a}}pplying the object.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''SEC''' — how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is active; generally only used in the &amp;quot;whatever (on)&amp;quot; forms.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Revert''' — the item type that the tool will revert to once its charges are drained&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Funct.''' — a function called when the tool is {{key|a}}pplied, or called once per turn if the tool is active.  The same function can be used for both.  See [https://github.com/TheDarklingWolf/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/iuse.h iuse.h] and [https://github.com/TheDarklingWolf/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/iuse.cpp iuse.cpp] for functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;
/* TOOLS&lt;br /&gt;
 * MAX is the maximum number of charges help.&lt;br /&gt;
 * DEF is the default number of charges--items will be generated with this&lt;br /&gt;
 *  many charges.&lt;br /&gt;
 * USE is how many charges are used up when {{key|a}}pplying the object.&lt;br /&gt;
 * SEC is how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is&lt;br /&gt;
 *  active; generally only used in the &amp;quot;&amp;lt;whatever&amp;gt; (on)&amp;quot; forms&lt;br /&gt;
 * FUEL is the type of charge the tool uses; set to AT_NULL if the item is&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Tools are your friends, many of them have their own unique functions and most are needed in some [[crafting recipes]] and [[construction]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Tools with their own function ==&lt;br /&gt;
These tools can be {{key|a}}pplied and each one has specific uses that can help you survive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Crowbar - your best friend. Will quietly open all glass and wooden doors that are locked, not causing alarms to go off on certain [[buildings]]. Also lifts manholes and has a decent bash rating - though the hammer is quicker and has higher bash, the hammer can't pry open doors. As well can used to remove boarding from windows and doors.&lt;br /&gt;
* Fire extinguisher - bulky and heavy, but great against small to moderate sized fires. Blazes and bonfires are hard to keep under control with this tool. {{key|a}}pplying it will prompt you to choose a direction to spray in.&lt;br /&gt;
* Flashlight - {{key|a}}pplying it turns it on, increasing visible tiles in the dark by a large amount. Attracts a crowd, but useful in the dark. Don't forget to turn it off when you don't need it anymore! Deconstructs into 100 batteries, amplifier circuit, 4 scrap metal, 10 copper wire.&lt;br /&gt;
* Geiger Counter (&amp;quot;geiger ctr&amp;quot; ingame) - will make constant clicking noises when radiation is present. You can choose to scan yourself or the surrounding tiles.  Useful if you have iodine on-hand to cure radiation.  Those already mutated by radiation will need purifier or [[royal jelly]].&lt;br /&gt;
* Hoe, used to create mounds of dirt. Mounds have a little higher than normal movement penalty (150).&lt;br /&gt;
* Hammer - you can {{key|a}}pply this to remove boarding from windows and doors (500 [[moving points]]). Along with nails and two by fours, this is used during construction.  Also make for a very powerful weapon, and aids when {{key|s}}mashing down doors or windows.&lt;br /&gt;
* Light Amp Goggles - Like the flashlight, but its more stealthy and requires a UPS to operate. Tints everything green.&lt;br /&gt;
* Lighter - a common, but useful item to have in your inventory. Takes up no space and has enough charges for a game's worth, these are one of the more convenient tools you can find. {{key|a}}pplying it will prompt you to choose a direction in which to light something. Also necessary for some items such as [[marijuana]] and molotov cocktails.&lt;br /&gt;
* Mop - Allows you to clean up spills.&lt;br /&gt;
* mp3 player - lets you listen to sweet tunes and increases your morale, if you can afford the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
* Portal generator - creates a single portal in a nearby location. You may safely step to this portal, it does currently nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
* Radio - turning it on causes it to blare an annoying emergency broadcast. Attracts a crowd and so far only useful to scrap for amp circuits. In the future, it will broadcast hails from close factions.&lt;br /&gt;
* Sewing Kit - quite commonly found in houses, these are necessary for repairing and [[crafting recipes|sew]] [[clothing]]. Make sure you have a high enough tailoring ability though! Comes with 50 charges, depending on your [[skill]], you'll use a proportionate amount of string and the potential risk of failure. Low skill can damage clothing! Uses thread as charges.&lt;br /&gt;
* Scissors - used to cut cotton based clothing into rags and ropes into strings. Unlimited charges, tailoring skill for more rags.&lt;br /&gt;
* Spray Can - can be used to spray graffiti on the floor by {{key|a}}pplying it on the desired location.&lt;br /&gt;
* Tazer - uses batteries to stun enemies. Needs batteries, can me used from inventory. Uses 100 batteries at once.&lt;br /&gt;
* Teleporter - if you are lucky, you might find a few in Labs or in a pile of corpses. {{key|a}}pplying it will teleport you a short distance away from you current position. Useful when in a pinch, but extremely dangerous to use underground. Teleporting into solid rock is not good.&lt;br /&gt;
* Two-Way Radio - most useful for contacting a faction for help. Most of the time they will send you a helpful NPC to accompany you in your travels.  (NPCs are a bit broken right now, don't rely on them.)&lt;br /&gt;
* Water Purifier - Nice to have if you aren't sure if you are drinking clean water. Food poisoning is nasty when 'Z's are around. If you {{key|a}}pply this to stacked items it purifies entire containers, but only one container at a time. (The difference between dirty and clean water will ensure that you don't double-purify, and that you don't drink dirty water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Functions shared by tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Knives, Lawnmower blades, etc - All these bladed implements can be used to cut up fabric, and carve pieces of wood into skewers.&lt;br /&gt;
* Steak knives and butcher knives can butcher corpses. Stand over a corpse and {{key|B}}butcher it. Using a butcher knive provides more meat, and is quicker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== List of tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Reloading time''' of tools is a sum of their weight and volume plus 100 additional moving points and [[Clothing#Hands|hands encumberment penalty]]. Reloading is interruptable activity.&lt;br /&gt;
** '''Unloading time''' is a half of reloading time, and full charge is unloaded in one action. Unloading is non-interruptable activity.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Use''' — how many charges are used up when {{key|a}}pplying the object.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''SEC''' — how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is active; generally only used in the &amp;quot;whatever (on)&amp;quot; forms.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Revert''' — the item type that the tool will revert to once its charges are drained&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Funct.''' — a function called when the tool is {{key|a}}pplied, or called once per turn if the tool is active.  The same function can be used for both.  See [https://github.com/TheDarklingWolf/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/iuse.h iuse.h] and [https://github.com/TheDarklingWolf/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/iuse.cpp iuse.cpp] for functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;
/* TOOLS&lt;br /&gt;
 * MAX is the maximum number of charges help.&lt;br /&gt;
 * DEF is the default number of charges--items will be generated with this&lt;br /&gt;
 *  many charges.&lt;br /&gt;
 * USE is how many charges are used up when {{key|a}}pplying the object.&lt;br /&gt;
 * SEC is how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is&lt;br /&gt;
 *  active; generally only used in the &amp;quot;&amp;lt;whatever&amp;gt; (on)&amp;quot; forms&lt;br /&gt;
 * FUEL is the type of charge the tool uses; set to AT_NULL if the item is&lt;br /&gt;
 *  unable to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;
 * REVERT is the item type that the tool will revert to once its charges are&lt;br /&gt;
 *  drained&lt;br /&gt;
 * FUNCTION is a function called when the tool is {{key|a}}pplied, or called once per&lt;br /&gt;
 *  turn if the tool is active.  The same function can be used for both.  See&lt;br /&gt;
 *  iuse.h and iuse.cpp for functions.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/Fun Fun] for that survivor just trying to get by!  Essential for those that want to make it past tomorrow.  The [[illiterate]] think these are excellent as a fire starter for that next [[gas station]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The percentage of a [[skill]] level that you will gain from reading is randomly chosen in a range from a minimum of &amp;quot;time / 10 + current [[intelligence]] / 4&amp;quot;, to a maximum of &amp;quot;time / 5 + current intelligence / 2 - current skill level&amp;quot;. Minimal number cannot be lower than 1, maximal number cannot be lower than 2 or higher than 10. So you will need to read a book at least ten times to level up the skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Character]] will refuse to read anything if his or her [[morale]] is lower than -40 or if it is too dark. &lt;br /&gt;
Note that the Night Vision [[mutation]]s do not help in darkness. You should use a [[flashlight]] or seek out the glow of a terminal to read at night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hard Int cap on books reported removed, lower Int incurs a speed penalty to reading.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/Fun Fun] for that survivor just trying to get by!  Essential for those that want to make it past tomorrow.  The [[illiterate]] think these are excellent as a fire starter for that next [[gas station]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The percentage of a [[skill]] level that you will gain from reading is randomly chosen in a range from a minimum of &amp;quot;time / 10 + current [[intelligence]] / 4&amp;quot;, to a maximum of &amp;quot;time / 5 + current intelligence / 2 - current skill level&amp;quot;. Minimal number cannot be lower than 1, maximal number cannot be lower than 2 or higher than 10. So you will need to read a book at least ten times to level up the skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Character]] will refuse to read anything if his or her [[morale]] is lower than -40 or if it is too dark. Note that Night Vision [[mutation]]s do not help with that, you anyway should use a [[flashlight]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hard Int cap on books reported removed, lower Int incurs a speed penalty to reading.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;46.115.82.184: /* How to craft */&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
== How to craft ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, just looting a city is unwise. You'll probably run into trouble at some point, and breaking windows or smashing down doors&lt;br /&gt;
can bring unwanted nasties even closer. Hell, some buildings are even alarmed. &lt;br /&gt;
So instead of looting something, why not try and craft it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are plenty of recipes, but most require a high skill-- e.g to add a silencer to a gun you need to have your firearms skill at 1 or higher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here's just a few examples for starting weapons that can be made only a few minutes into the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''Nail board'''&lt;br /&gt;
* A two-by-four with a few nails in. It makes a nice club for the early game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tools!&lt;br /&gt;
*A rock.&lt;br /&gt;
*Some nails&lt;br /&gt;
*Some wood.&lt;br /&gt;
You wake up in a shelter. run outside and look for a suitable rock. &lt;br /&gt;
Run back inside, smash up two or three benches. press &amp;amp; to open the crafting menu and you should be able to craft&lt;br /&gt;
this easily-made club from the remnants. For now just smash furniture, windows and doors etc to get any nails and two-by-fours that you might need. Later on you'll want to deconstruct them to get the most materials for your time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''Wood spear!'''&lt;br /&gt;
* It's a nice throwing weapon and it's pretty light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tools!&lt;br /&gt;
*Steak knife/combat knife/butcher's knife etc.&lt;br /&gt;
*A heavy stick/ a two-by-four.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, such a simple weapon. sneak into a local house, check the kitchen for a cutting implement. Unfortunately stuff like butcher's knives don't make the best weapons in the early game, but you'll need at least one for butchering animals for food anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
Tip: If the front door it locked, smash a window facing away from town with your nailboard. This drops the sheets that were used as curtains and a heavy stick, which was the curtain-rod. Voila, open the &amp;amp; menu and craft youself a wooden spear. Its a pretty good throwing weapon and can also be used when you're cooking meat without a pot. you can also find heavy sticks a short walk into any nearby forest, or just use a two-by-four from smashing some furniture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''Crowbar'''&lt;br /&gt;
You can also smash the locker in the evac shelter with a rock to give you a pipe. Using the same rock as a tool you can turn the pipe into a crowbar. It is very useful for prying open locked doors and manholes that give you access to the sewers and other places. Its also a good melee weapon. (requires one skill point in mechanic)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''Construction!'''&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, so you've broken a window. don't jump through it yet or you'll probably cut yourself like some little emo kid. Press * to open the construction menu, and then g to select &amp;gt;clear a broken window. this means you can jump through it without damage. Also it's much, much easier to board up a window than repair a smashed door. Peek out a window and see if there's anything nasty nearby-- if there isn't, press 'c' to close the window so we can continue unmolested.&lt;br /&gt;
press * and then f to move furniture. Use this to move things like armoires and dressers in front of windows-- but remember this is only really to block line-of-sight, and you'll usually want at least one or two escape routes (usually the front door, as that blocks light anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''Boarding/Taping up a window'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tools!&lt;br /&gt;
*A hammer, two-by-fours, nails&lt;br /&gt;
*Alternatively, duct-tape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very, very simple. Breaks line-of sight, so you can hide easily. Try not to make any noise and hide in a central room away from the entrances. You'll need 50 pieces of duct tape per window, and you usually find duct tape in rolls of 100, 200 or 250. It's quick and easy-- and you can still break through if need be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To board it up you need a good amount of wood and nails-- but most importantly, a hammer. If you're lucky you'll find one on a corpse or dead zed-- if not, you may be able to find one in a hardware store. A hammer allows you to do quite a lot of construction and can be used as an impromptu weapon if need be (but then again, so can tattered leather pants.) Boarding up windows and doors not only defends your supposed hideout, but blocks line of sight. Again, remember to save a few escape routes and try not to make any noise while inside, or the horde may just come a knocking. For extra survivability drag some furniture in front of your boarded-up windows. That should give you a few more turns to either wake up/finish puking/reloading etc and get the hell out of dodge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''Traps!'''&lt;br /&gt;
Let's get to the meaty stuff. you probably won't be able to craft much at the start, but if you make 4 wood spears and somehow manage to obtain a mystical shovel (rarely in hardware stores, you can usually find them at farmhouses and barns so get exploring the countryside) then dig a pit from the * menu. You then enter the &amp;amp; menu and scroll through until you find the 'spike pit' trap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
** '''Bear trap!'''&lt;br /&gt;
Skill requirements!&lt;br /&gt;
*Primary skill: Mechanics 1&lt;br /&gt;
*Secondary skill: Traps 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tools!&lt;br /&gt;
* A wrench&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Resources!&lt;br /&gt;
* x3 Scrap metal&lt;br /&gt;
* x1 spring&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A very, very, VERY useful trap. Simple to make, they don't weight much and they hit the weakpoint for MASSIVE damage and have a prolonged stunning effect on any enemy that trips them.(although some enemies are fast enough that they can run over one without tripping it, which is why 2-3 in a line is a nice idea for trap dodgers and plain redundancy.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a few beartraps your safety is all but guaranteed-- and you can even use them in an offensive capacity. by placing them at a corner and luring a zombie over them. After one use it needs to be reset, and it can get stuck inside of the larger zombies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, if you're near to a forest, they tend to catch a regular supply of crunchy critters to butcher for food.&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, they make a loud SNAP! when they activate, which can alert you to nasties (or tasty critters) nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
WARNING: Some powerful or large enemies that trip a beartrap and survive will drag that beartrap with them-- it's still stuck to them until they die. However, as long as you have enough traps, you can disarm one and place it somewhere else as long as the enemy is trapped in one. Generally, as long as a hulk hits 5 or 6 bear traps it's either severely injured or outright dead-- and you can also throw spears, rocks or gun it down while it's giving you the evil eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only problem I see with this is the reliance on springs. Only available by finding them in craters, and metal wreckage sites. Look for craters on the map get those springs. Military outposts with turrets-- throw rocks at them at night. Turrets drop both scrap metal, steel chunks, lumps, and different types of ammunition. And a last but very rare source is the humble lawnmower. When deconstructed it also provides a few springs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**'''spiked board trap!!'''&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, get this. You get some pieces of wood and take a hammer, bash a WHOLE LOAD of nails in it like a boss... and then have it point nail-side up. I haven't used this because frankly the nail requirement is pretty huge-- it's something like 5x two by fours and x20 nails, although it's very simple to make, the components are certainly more common than springs. However, as a bonus unlike the bear trap it doesn't need to be reactivated after every use. It just sits there, anything that walks over it gets hurt. However they weight a whopping two or three times as much as a bear trap-- and bear traps do a much, much more damage. It's a nice idea if you want to put up roadblocks of spiked boards in areas though for running massive hordes back and forth over them until the nails shred their feet, then their legs, torso and hands as they try to crawl after you...&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
