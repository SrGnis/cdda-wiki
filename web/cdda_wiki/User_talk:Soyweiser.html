<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Item_Rarity">Item Rarity</span></h2>
<p>My pleasure, but I was wondering how do you find the rarity of an item? - RiftNinja
</p>
<dl><dd>Mind if I intervene and say that this is probably an outdated piece of data? Some of the items have it (I looked it up), but most aren't and are fine. Anyway, you could look into json files if you really want to add the rarities. <a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User:Greattuna&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User:Greattuna (page does not exist)">Greattuna</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Greattuna.html" title="User talk:Greattuna">talk</a>) 13:45, 18 June 2015 (PDT)
<dl><dd>I think item rarity is relative. iirc the way items are distributed is using 'drop' lists. Each location and spawn has its own lists. So while shorts are common on the normal Z's they are a rare drop in a bathroom, and never drop on a migo. (By example, not actual game data). Do some items have an item rarity then? --<a href="./User:Soyweiser.html" title="User:Soyweiser">Soyweiser</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:23, 19 June 2015 (PDT)
<dl><dd>Few of them, actually, but I don't see the game using it. Items are in groups, and drops are generated based on that. Probability of dropping from the group is written in the item_groups json, drops from the monster in monster_drops, and loot from building is set on mapgen json. So, no use for rarity. <a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User:Greattuna&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User:Greattuna (page does not exist)">Greattuna</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Greattuna.html" title="User talk:Greattuna">talk</a>) 02:23, 19 June 2015 (PDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span id="reloaded_&amp;_original_ammo_decision"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="reloaded_.26_original_ammo_decision">reloaded &amp; original ammo decision</span></h2>
<p>So, as I'm going through the books (now I'm also adding craft item links) I'm running into the reloaded ammo which has brought up an issue.  The original ammo pages list the crafting recipes but can't be crafted.  The reloaded ammo have no pages in the wiki.  They are nearly identical, but some of the damage stats differ between the two ammo types.  I can redirect all the reloaded pages to the original ammo (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="./10mm_auto.html" title="10mm auto">10mm auto</a> &amp; <a class="new" href="./index.php?title=Reloaded_10mm_auto&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="Reloaded 10mm auto (page does not exist)">reloaded 10mm auto</a>) and ignore the slight differences in stats, or, create new pages for the reloaded ammo and move the crafting recipes to the proper pages....or, alternatively combine the two onto one page,noting the discrepancies in stats.  Thoughts or preferences? No rush on an answer, I'll be sticking with ID work for now, but I'm identifying future things to work on as I run into them. My inclination is to make the new pages but it'll be a lot more work. <a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User:Turn478&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User:Turn478 (page does not exist)">Turn478</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Turn478.html" title="User talk:Turn478">talk</a>) 06:42, 18 July 2015 (PDT)

<p>Is it okay to edit that guide? I am asking this because the notice has been there for days and without any actual activity or discussion on the topic of deletion. I agree that the guide is outdated and COMPILE.md has better information but the section on changing the font is good as many new players don't know that, especially the ones on Windows.

</p>
<dl><dd>It is okey to edit the page, yes. I wanted to delete it because the forums had better guides that people actually used and looked at. Wiki's are not good for this kind of information if nobody stands up as a 'champion' to keep the guide working and correct. A bad outdated guide to get the stuff compiling which doesn't work at all is way worse than no guide. And we already have the forums, and the github information. Which makes a 'how to compile' guide on the wiki redundant, and easily outdated. At least a year ago Coolthulhu did some work on it and removed all the redundant guides. My preferred method of creating a 'wiki' guide is to point towards to forums or github. NOT to repeat it again on the wiki, without anybody keeping an eye on it. (There are only so many hours people can work on projects like this, you don't want to spend time on keeping 4 locations up to date when you could simply add referrals to better pages.

<p>I am not going to add mouse to the list myself because the IOS version is still 0.C Cooper, I've not had time to squeeze in any time on the experimental due to lockdown...
I know absolutely nothing about Mouse, so you may want to add it in to how you can judge it's combat capabilities when I've added more of them, I bet you can only guess what I consider the ultimate city clearer. (-;
The good news is I've returned to work, so in the free time between my projects I can squeeze in a bit of research. The bad news is I don't know when or if another lockdown will happen, so I'm leaving Mouse to focus on what mutations are with me regardless of version... -<a class="new" href="./index.php?title=User:Mrstickman1997&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="User:Mrstickman1997 (page does not exist)">Mrstickman1997</a>

<p>You see, there are a LOT of monsters that fit the criteria of being bosses in the game; having red text displayed on their names symbolising their deadliness (though not all red text monsters I could consider bosses like the zombie master), their high health, high damage, and the fact that they sometimes need quite a lot of time, resources and special strategies to kill successfully.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Several_questions">Several questions</span></h2>
<p>While updating the <a href="./Flu_shot.html" title="Flu shot">flu shot</a> page for the experimental (to be 0.F), several questions came up.
</p>
<ul><li>How is it handled when something in the game is renamed? (e.g. <a href="./Flu_shot_(effect).html" title="Flu shot (effect)">Flu shot (effect)</a> &gt; <a class="new" href="./index.php?title=Vaccinated&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="Vaccinated (page does not exist)">Vaccinated</a>) Is there a way to request pages be moved?
<ul><li>For some reason, <a href="./Special:ListGroupRights.html" title="Special:ListGroupRights">this wiki restricts the "move" right to administrators</a>. Even the "Trusted Contributors" group, which can delete pages, can't move them. (Compare to the <a class="extiw" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights#List_of_permissions.html" title="mw:Manual:User rights">MediaWiki default of giving it to users</a>, or <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListGroupRights.html" title="wikipedia:Special:ListGroupRights">Wikipedia, which gives it to autoconfirmed users</a>.)</li></ul></li>
<li><code>{{<a href="./Template:Volume.html" title="Template:Volume">volume</a>}}</code> (used in the <code>{{<a href="./Template:Food.html" title="Template:Food">food</a>}}</code> infobox) divides a volume value by 4, but it looks like the json just says e.g. "10ml" now. Will this be updated now, or when 0.F is released?</li>
<li>Why is <a href="./Flu_shot.html" title="Flu shot">flu shot</a> using a food infobox, anyway?</li>
<li>Are you (or is anyone) planning to automate the data in the infoboxes?</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Versioning">Versioning</span></h2>
<p>From <a href="./Talk:Main_Page.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a>:
</p>
<dl><dd>The wiki should reflect the most recent experimental release. There simply isn't enough time people put into the wiki to keep different versions up to date. And esp at the moment the latest stable release is several years ago. It was <a href="./0.C_(Cooper).html" title="0.C (Cooper)">0.C (Cooper)</a>. The best way to go about this is to tag stuff you write with the version you wrote it for. For this I created the templates <a href="./Template:Ver.html" title="Template:Ver">template:Ver</a>, which you can use to tag an entire page as being of a certain version. And the template: <a href="./Template:InlineVer.html" title="Template:InlineVer">template:inlineVer</a>, which you can use during text to properly refer to a version. I even created methods to refer to the latest <a href="./0.D_(Danny).html" title="0.D (Danny)">0.D (Danny)</a> (*).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>(*):This refered to, at the time of writing, to "The experimental version". While the code already said 0.D which is (was) not out yet. The inlineVer template (and the ver template) makes updating to a new version easy. As I made it so that referring to the version that isn't out yet, automatically gets translated to 'The experimental version' so that when there is a release, not all the references to 'the experimental' need to be updated to (for example) 0.D, and only the two templates need to be updated. So use those templates. --<a href="./User:Soyweiser.html" title="User:Soyweiser">Soyweiser</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 14:43, 7 November 2017 (MST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>To update this information in 2020. It seems the experimentals now are pretty experimental. So we probably should work on keeping the wiki mostly up to date with the stables and note where an update is specifically for the experimentals. Esp as the containers are now changing atm. Ideally we would have a dwarf fortress like versioning system, but we don't have the wikiediting manpower to keep this up to date. --<a href="./User:Soyweiser.html" title="User:Soyweiser">Soyweiser</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 05:11, 12 May 2020 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Hi. If that's still correct (I am inquiring about what's downloaded the most on <a class="external text" href="https://cataclysmdda.org/.html" rel="nofollow">cataclysmdda.org</a>), then I suggest that, after 0.F comes out:
</p>
<ul><li>On pages based on 0.F but with changes in the experimental version, we start using an adapted version of <a class="external text" href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Template:Upcoming.html" rel="nofollow">this template</a> from the NetHack wiki.</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, the page is about something only in the experimental version, then use the existing <a href="./Template:Ver.html" title="Template:Ver">template:Ver</a> system to indicate as much.</li></ul>
