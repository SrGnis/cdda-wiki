[[File:Gunther hermann.PNG|thumb|330px|''Gunther Hermann in [[wikipedia:Deus_Ex|Deus Ex]], a game which likely influenced (and continues to influence) bionics in Cataclysm and C:DDA'']]&lt;!--

-->'''Bionics''', also known as '''CBMs''' or Compact Bionic Modules, are cybernetic enhancements that can be added to the player, granting various passive and activated abilities. Along with [[mutation]]s, they are one of two paths to transhumanism typically taken by late-game characters. Some offer powerful abilities such as [[Probability Travel|teleportation]] and [[Time Dilation|stopping time]], many of which are unique in the game, and some are useless or even a liability when installed. Certain [[professions]] can also spawn with bionics. A [[Power Storage]] bionic and a [[:Category:Power Source Bionic|bionic capable of charging the battery]] are necessary for the use of most bionics.

You can access the bionics menu via {{key|p}}, where you can see and manage all your installed bionics.

Here is a full updated list of all the bionics [[BionicsList| list]]

== CBMs ==
Here's a full [[BionicsList| list]]

CBMs are surgery kits that contain all the parts required to install a cybernetic implant, also called a bionic, in a human. Manufacturers' warranties insist on using an [[autodoc]] or having a fully qualified technician and medical doctor to assist in the installation in a proper medical facility. CBMs are rare to find among the general public, being mostly concentrated in scientific or military areas. All CBMs are made of steel and plastic, are 2.5 L, and do 8 bashing damage when wielded.

The most common places to find CBMs are [[science lab]]s and [[microlab]]s. Other places to get them are military locations like [[Military Bunker|bunkers]] and [[Military Base|bases]], death drops from [[zombie scientist]]s, trading with [[Hub 01]], and very rarely from [[electronics store]]s, [[doctor's office]]s, [[police station]]s, [[bank]] vaults, and many other places. 

Aside from labs, the primary way to get bionics is by dissecting certain corpses. This takes a significant amount of time and requires a tool with [http://cdda-trunk.chezzo.com/qualities/CUT_FINE fine cutting]. Corpses will give varying numbers of bionics from various pools, depending on the monster, with [[Power Storage]] CBMs being most common. Your success probability when dissecting for bionics depends on your tool's fine cutting level, your [[dexterity]], your [[First Aid]] skill, and to a lesser degree your [[Electronics]] skill. It's also decreased by damage to a corpse, so make sure not to pulp corpses you plan on dissecting. A failure gets you [[burnt out bionic]]s, which are mostly useless. 

Corpses which yield bionics are:
* [[Broken cyborg]]
* [[Prototype cyborg]]
* [[Shocker zombie]]
* [[Skeletal shocker]]
* [[Zombie scientist]]
* [[Zombie technician]]
* [[Shocker brute]]
* [[Incandescent husk]]
* [[Zombie bio-operator]]

== Post-0.F Experimental Build Changes ==
Experimental builds beyond release {{inlineVer|0.G}} is making changes to availability of CBMs, which is still actively being implemented with the [[Exodii]] faction, and the list of corpses which yield bionics has been reduced to the following:
* [[Broken cyborg]]
* [[Prototype cyborg]]
* [[Zomborg]]

Certain Science Labs, Hospitals and Doctor's offices will still generate with CBMs.

Bionics can be reliably bought from [[Rubik]] in exodii castle.

== Preparing CBMs ==
CBMs you loot throughout the world are packaged and ready to install, but CBMs dissected out of corpses come filthy and deployed. An autodoc will not allow you to install it this way, even if you're ready to shove zombie gore in your chest cavity. There are four steps you'll have to remember in order to prepare a harvested CBM for installation.
* Wash it with a [[sponge]], [[rag]], [[washing kit]], or [[dishwasher]].
* Reset it by going to its item info from your inventory and selecting Mend. This takes 45 minutes and requires [[Electronics]] 2, [[First Aid]] 4, [[Mechanics]] 3, and tools with [http://cdda-trunk.chezzo.com/qualities/WRENCH_FINE fine bolt turning] and [http://cdda-trunk.chezzo.com/qualities/SCREW_FINE fine screw driving].
* Package it in an [[autoclave pouch]]. This requires it to be reset first.
* Sterilize it in an [[autoclave]]. Make sure it's packaged first.

There are two types of autoclaves, the stationary furniture and the item version. The furniture version is currently only found in [[research facility|research facilities]], while the item version may spawn in various locations like labs, [[hospital]]s, and [[doctor's office]]s. The furniture autoclave consumes 64 units or 16L of water per cycle and does not need to be powered, while the item version consumes 2L of water and must be loaded with a heavy battery. It requires 8200 battery power to run, so it can only be used with the [[heavy plutonium fuel battery]]. Alternatively, it could be installed onto a vehicle as a [[mountable autoclave]], which enables it to draw power from the vehicle, drastically decreases the operation cost. An autoclave cycle is 90 minutes.

== Installation ==
The bionic installation process requires an [[autodoc]], a highly advanced medical apparatus that can conduct medical operations on players and [[NPC]]s, and some specific monsters—namely [[prototype cyborg]]s. For now, they are only used for installation/uninstallation of bionics and splinting [[broken limb]]s, but other types of operations are planned for the future. 

The player has to manually configure the autodoc prior to every operation. Alternatively, if there is a friendly NPC with better suitable skills nearby, he'll begin configuring the autodoc for the player. Operation success chance is displayed in the autodoc menu, as is anesthetic usage and time of the operation.

If the patient does not have the [[Sensory Dulling]] CBM or the [[Deadened]] mutation, an [[anesthetic kit]] will be needed. An anesthetic kit holds 3L of [[anesthetic]] and can be reloaded indefinitely. A surgical procedure will consume a certain amount of anesthetic, which depends on the patient's weight and the difficulty of the bionic. After configuring the autodoc, it will inject anesthesia, putting the character into a state of [[narcosis]] where they won't react to most stimuli, including sounds and even monsters gnawing on their arm, so it's best to make sure you are safe before conducting the operation. 

Installing bionics is based off [[intelligence]] and various [[skills]]. The most important skill is [[First Aid]], followed by [[Computers]] and [[Electronics]]. For the best chances of operation success, raise those skills as high as you can, and also make sure as much as possible that no penalty is decreasing your intelligence. 

The chance of success is equal to the following:&lt;br />

&lt;code>Chance of Success = (100 * Difficulty) / (Difficulty + sqrt(1 / Difficulty))&lt;/code> (see [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/0.F-3/src/bionics.cpp#L2092-L2096 bionics.cpp(0.F-3)])

where

* &lt;code>Difficulty = Adjusted Skill / (4 * Bionic Difficulty)&lt;/code> (see [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/0.F-3/src/bionics.cpp#L2087-L2090 bionics.cpp(0.F-3)])
* &lt;code>Adjusted Skill = Skill - lesser of 40 or (Skill * 0.9)&lt;/code> (see [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/0.F-3/src/bionics.cpp#L2028-L2030 bionics.cpp(0.F-3)])
* &lt;code>Skill = Intelligence * 4 + First Skill * 4 + Second Skill * 3 + Third Skill&lt;/code> (see [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/0.F-3/src/bionics.cpp#L2053-L2056 bionics.cpp(0.F-3)])

Example interactive graph for &lt;code>Skill&lt;/code> vs &lt;code>Chance of Success&lt;/code> for &lt;code>Bionic Difficulty = 9&lt;/code>: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/otllgkhfkp

The time an autodoc operation takes depends on the bionic's difficulty. The rule is 20 minutes per one point of difficulty, so installation time can vary from 20 minutes for the easiest bionics like [[Power Storage]] to four hours for the hardest ones like [[Synaptic Accelerator]].

A body can hold Power Storage/mk. II bionics up to 2,000kJ of maximum power, and one of each other bionic. However, the Bionics interface can only accommodate about 30 or so before it starts to have trouble maintaining letters for all of them. Take this into account when you install a lot of bionics.

=== Installation Failure ===
The possible outcomes of installation are:
* successful installation
* failure without incident (Failure level of 0)
* failure with a chance of pain (Failure level of 1)
* failure with a chance of severe body damage (Failure level of 2 or 3)
* failure with a chance to install a [[#Faulty bionics|malfunctioning bionic]] (Failure level of 4 or 5)
** failure with a chance of permanent power loss (this replaces installing a malfunctioning bionic if you have all of the malfunctioning bionics.)

Failing to install the bionic will return it to you, deployed and non-sterile, unless you managed to install a faulty bionic instead. Only the body parts a bionic occupies will be damaged. How much you failed by is then further modified to determine your failure level. 

Your maximum level of failure is determined by the following formula:
&lt;pre>
Maximum Failure = SQRT ((100 - Chance of Success) * 4 * Bionic Difficulty / Adjusted Skill)
&lt;/pre>

Maximum failure must be at least 4 to install a faulty CBM. In practice, any installation with a chance of failure higher than 28% can potentially give a faulty CBM. The exception is characters who started the game with a medical profession, which prevents any chance of a faulty bionic being installed.

Failing to install or uninstall a bionic can inflict up to 80 damage. This could very well instantly kill your character, so be warned.

== Powering bionics ==
Some bionics don't need to be powered or activated, but many consume bionic power to fuel their usage. Max bionic power is listed on the ({{k|@}}) statistics screen in the {{igs|BIONICS|ltgray}} section below the traits section, while your current power is listed in the sidebar under Power. You can also use the bionics menu ({{k|p}}) to see current and max bionic power and a list of all your bionics, which you can toggle on and off from this screen. Bionic power is measured in kilojoules, with a maximum of 2100 kJ that the player can gain. You can increase your max bionic power by installing the [[Power Storage]] or [[Power Storage Mk. II]] CBMs for 100 and 250 max power respectively. You can also set bionics to start producing power when you got &lt;75, &lt;50, &lt;25 or &lt;0 for each different bionic({{k|A}}) while in the bionic menu

=== Sources of bionics power ===
To power your bionics, you will need a CBM that can charge your internal batteries. There are several bionics that can do so, with varying practicality and efficiency.

* [[Battery System]] - Consumes [[battery|batteries]] for power.
* [[Cable Charger System]] - Uses [[Jumper cable|jumper cables]] to drain power from vehicles.
* [[Ethanol Burner]] - Consumes [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[denatured alcohol]] to generate power. Heats up your body while active.
* [[Gasoline Fuel Cell]] - Generates a lot of power by consuming [[gasoline]], but heats your body significantly.
* [[Joint Torsion Ratchet]] - Generates a small amount of power while walking. When activated, generates more power at the cost of increasing [[stamina]] burn.
* [[Metabolic Interchange]] - Burns [[Stored Calories|calories]] to generate power while active. Automatically turns off if you drop below 80% of starting calories, the point at which you begin to get messages.
* [[Trickle Charger]] - A low-power, long-lasting bioelectric charger powered by small-scale nuclear decay.  Energy output is low but requires no fuel source, and multiple copies can be installed.

== Faulty bionics ==
As you can expect, things sometimes go wrong with shoving technology in your body. Several bionics exist that have purely negative effects, which hamper your character until they are uninstalled. A severely failed install can randomly install a faulty bionic. They also come pre-installed with certain [[professions]], such as [[Prototype Cyborg (profession)|prototype]] and [[failed cyborg]]s, which [[Guide: Broken Cyborg|challenge]] you to uninstall those bionics before they kill you. Faulty CBMs in item form can be dissected out of cyborgs.

{{List/faultybionics}}

== Removing Bionics ==
Uninstallation in {{InlineVer|0.D}} is only possible through the autodoc or NPC surgeon. All features of installing (need for anesthesia, time required for operation, etc.) are applicable for uninstallation too. Uninstallation is noticeably more difficult than installing bionics and can do serious/fatal damage on a failure. On a success, no damage is taken. To determine the removal difficulty, the bionic difficulty is taken, and 2 points are added to it. Faulty bionics vary a lot in difficulty values.

== [[Gameplay_Mods|Mods]] ==
===Manual Bionic Installation===
Allows you to install bionics the old way, without use of an autodoc. To manually install a CBM, you'll have to {{k|a}}ctivate it first. Skills used are electronics, first aid, and mechanics, in that order. Anesthetic is not used. Attempting to manual self-install a bionic will practice a character's skills. Amount of gained exp is based on chance to fail current installation:
&lt;pre>
for electronics: (100 - Chance of Success) * 1.5
for first aid: (100 - Chance of Success) * 1.0
for mechanics: (100 - Chance of Success) * 0.5
&lt;/pre>

=== Bionic Slots===
Bionic Slots are not a thing in the base game. They are a limitation if using the mod Aftershock.
Limits the number of bionics you can install in each body part. Each bionic takes up a certain number of slots. Available slots are as follows.
* Torso - 80
* Head - 18
* Eyes - 4
* Mouth - 4
* Left/right arm - 20
* Left/right hand - 5
* Left/right leg - 30
* Left/right foot - 7

=== Safe Autodoc ===
Removes any and all failure chance for installing bionics.

== Changes ==
* {{InlineVer|0.7}} - Bionics can be retrieved from butchered player corpses.
* {{InlineVer|0.B}} - Feature to remove bionics added; previous versions only allowed removal with critical failure on install.
* {{InlineVer|0.D}} - (Un)installing bionics requires autodoc and anesthesia, beta version of the debug slots system.
* {{InlineVer|0.F}} - Bionics now come from one of alien factions. Limited amount of enemies which can be harvested for bionics, introduced bionic merchant.
