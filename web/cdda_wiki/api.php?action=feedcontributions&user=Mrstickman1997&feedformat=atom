Lakes are colossal bodies of deep water, they are much bigger than [[river]]s, and can contain isolated structures such as island [[prison]]s, lighthouse islands, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
It is best accessed via [[Vehicles|boat]], or by [[fish]] mutants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While rich in fish, water and occasional structures, lakes can also rarely contain dangerous monsters such as the dreaded [[jawed terror]].&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

{{tocr}}&lt;br /&gt;
Skills are raised upon practice (combat, [[crafting]], [[tools|tool]] usage). Practice is multiplied by your current focus / 100; therefore focus pool level above 100 provides a bonus to the amount of skill gained, while amounts below 100 provide a penalty. The focus pool is not capped, but it requires higher morale to increase to higher levels, every few turns your focus is increased or decreased depending on your current morale. You can increase the speed at which you gain focus by increasing your morale.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of {{InlineVer|0.C}}, performing a crafting or construction task of certain difficulty can only bring your skill to (difficulty*1.25)+1, rounded down. For example, boiling water and digging pits (skill 0) will only bring cooking and construction to 1. Even the easiest task will still stop skill rust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
You can also increase skill levels by reading [[books]] or being taught by [[NPC]]s. Note that reading skill books costs focus, but being trained does not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Melee and Firearms skill will improve both accuracy and damage of their respective weapons, but not as much as the weapon's main skill (handguns, cutting weapons etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Stats]] will also affect a player's skills by making them more/less effective depending on the value of the stat. Dexterity will affect the accuracy and effectiveness for most attacks. Strength will affect the damage of all melee attacks. Intelligence can improve certain skills, increase the rate of learning, and reduce the time needed to read a  book. Perception can increase a player's accuracy for ranged attacks, and increases trap detection. &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If [[options|skill rust]] is turned on (Default in {{inlineVer|0.D}} is off), skills will degrade after a while without practice. Every X turns, there is a percentage chance the current practice percentage may be decremented. This chance is multiplied by 1.33 with the [[Forgetful]] trait and by 0.66 with the [[Good Memory]] trait. Skills that are displayed as red or pink have gone long enough without practice that they are in danger of rusting. If rust takes the current practice percentage below zero and the current rust setting allows level loss, the skill level will be decremented and then the practice percentage will be set to 99%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Enhanced Memory Banks]] [[bionic]] will prevent skill rust as long as power is available.&lt;br /&gt;

= Disabling skills =&lt;br /&gt;
As you increase your skills, the [[focus]] level is drained. For this reason, it might be a good idea to disable your progression on a skill. Normally, a skill people disable is the driving skill, because it drains your focus every time you drive and once you get to a certain level, further getting better is not much worth it. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FdCwyJUvJY Cataclysm Quick Tip #23 - Disabling Skills].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== How to ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Go to your character screen by pressing {{k|@}};&lt;br /&gt;
# Press {{k|Tab}} until you get to the skills screen (the tall, lower left one);&lt;br /&gt;
# Then highlight the skill you want to disable and;&lt;br /&gt;
# Press {{k|Enter}} to disable the skill, you should see its text changing color as you disable it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Skills =&lt;br /&gt;
== Bartering ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in bargaining, haggling, and trading with others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of {{InlineVer|0.B}}, trade values are governed by a comparison between your bartering skill and that of the NPC, with the more skilled party getting a better deal.  There are Static NPCs willing to trade with you, and they are fairly skilled at bartering, so if you want good stuff in trade, it would be a good idea to take a point or two of skill in Bartering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Computers==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in accessing and manipulating computers. Higher levels can allow a user to navigate complex software systems and even bypass their security. Theoretically Computer skill can be increased by bypassing the security of computer systems but the gain from bypassing the security of a single system is so minute that its not practical to increase the Computer skill by this method. Furthermore, failure in bypassing the security of a system can cause some anti-breach systems to be deployed (manhacks, electric shocks and such) which can prove dangerous and sometimes, fatal. In practice, Computer skill can only be increased by books as opposed to most of the skills which can be increased by experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Construction==&lt;br /&gt;
Your general competence in building [[construction]]. This governs the complexity of structures that can be built, and the time required to build them; difficulty levels presume that you're working by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can raise this skill by deconstructing and reconstructing [[furniture]] and by chopping [[tree]]s (using the construction menu, smashing doesn't count). To effectively raise this skill by this method, its necessary that the constructed furniture requires the same skill level as your current skill level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Craft boxes in the wiki and on the [http://cdda-trunk.chezzo.com/construction/categories/FURN Item Browser] construction may also be referred to as &amp;quot;carpentry&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In {{inlineVer|0.D}} the construction skill has been removed, the various constructions now have different skill requirements, related to the type of construction. Such as cloth related constructions are now [[Tailoring]], food constructions are now a [[Cooking]] skill, and the general ones are now part of [[Fabrication]], etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Cooking==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in combining [[comestibles|food]] ingredients [[crafting#Food|to make]] other, tastier food items. It may also be used in certain chemical mixtures and other, more esoteric tasks. You can raise this skill slowly by cooking food and other items which use this skill; several cookbooks and chemistry textbooks exist to speed the process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Driving ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in operating and steering a vehicle in motion. A higher level allows greater control over vehicles at higher speeds, and reduces the penalty of shooting while [[Vehicles#Driving_vehicles|driving]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Low skill levels will result in you &amp;quot;fumbling with vehicle's controls&amp;quot;, which turns the vehicle without your intervention.  Since driving skill is trained by maneuvering the vehicle, recovering from these fumbles will eventually reduce their frequency; driving vehicles over a long distance will also achieve this, and books exist to raise your skill to 3 and 4. Increased skill levels will cause you to drive vehicles in an increasingly stable manner, and at 4, you will no longer fumble with the vehicle's controls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Electronics==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in dealing with electrical systems, used in the [[crafting#Electronic|craft]] and repair of objects with electrical components. This skill is an important part of installing and managing bionic implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apart from reading [[books]] on the subject, you can raise this skill by disassembling {{k|(}} any electronic device you find and don't need (like any [[flashlight]]s after your first). Moreover, disassembling flashlights will cause you to learn the recipe which can be used to create more flashlights thus increasing your overall skill.  With that said, repeated flashlight assembly/disassembly was considered excessively grindy and resulted in the XP cap based on recipe difficulty in the newer versions, so to effectively increase skills by this method make sure that the item you're constructing is requiring the same skill level as your current skill level, i.e. the required level should be equal to your current skill level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Fabrication ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in working with raw materials and shaping them into useful objects. This skill plays an important role in the [[crafting]] of many objects.  Though several relevant books are available, this skill can be effectively raised by crafting weapons and objects which can be disassembled. To raise this skill by this method make sure that the required skill of the said object is same as your current skill level. Objects which can be disassembled (such as bows) and are best suited for this method.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First Aid ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in effecting emergency medical treatment. Higher levels allow better use of medicines and items like [[bandage|bandages]] and all of the products from [[first aid kit]]s, and reduce the failure and complication rates of medical procedures. This skill plays a vital role in the installation of bionic modules and allows for better use of medical equipment. There are a few good books on the topic, and a book to get you up to level one can be gotten from disassembling a [[first aid kit]]. At level one you learn to craft the various [[Arm splint|splint]] items.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using medical items very slightly increases this skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Mechanics==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in engineering, maintaining and [[vehicles#Vehicle repairs|repairing vehicles]] and other mechanical systems. This skill covers the craft of items with complex parts (like homemade guns), and plays a role in the installation of [[bionic]] equipment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apart from reading [[books]] on the subject, you can easily raise this skill by [[Vehicles#Modifying_a_vehicle|removing and reinstalling]] parts of a vehicle, or using a soldering iron to repair plastic items.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of {{InlineVer|0.C}}, experience from removing non-destroyed car parts is not capped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Speaking==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in speaking to [[NPC|other people]]. Covers ability in boasting, flattery, threats, persuasion, lies, and other facets of interpersonal communication. Works best in conjunction with a high level of intelligence. Even though NPC's may seem like a waste of time, this skill can increase the chance of getting some free equipment from NPC's that spawn in shelters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Survival==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in surviving the wilderness, and in crafting various basic survival items. This also covers your ability to skin and butcher animals for meat and hides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a more efficient butchering you'll need this skill at level 3, dexterity at 8 and strength at 4 or higher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apart from reading [[books]] on the subject, you can easily raise this skill by foraging ({{k|e}}xamining [[underbrush]]), butchering corpses (including those of zombies), [[crafting#Misc|crafting]] stone hammers and, later, digging sticks and snare triggers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Athletics==&lt;br /&gt;
Your ability to stay afloat and move around in bodies of water. This skill keeps you from drowning, affects your combat effectiveness and speed in deep water, and determines the detriment of swimming with heavier gear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When your athletics skill is too low to let you stay afloat, you'll still be able to walk on the bottom of the water body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just because you can swim in water, [[Jawed terror|doesn't always mean you should]], look and prepare before you swim...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Tailoring==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in the craft and repair of [[clothing]], bags, blankets and other textiles. Affects knitting, sewing, stitching, weaving, and nearly anything else involving a needle and thread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a surprisingly important skill for any survivor that wants to live longer. Without this skill, you won't be able to restore ruined clothing you find or repair clothing that was been damaged by monsters. Once you get to level 2, the skill becomes much easier to use and you may be able to get some good clothing repaired or made for the days ahead, as well as making your current clothes sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A good way to increase this skill is to repair clothing you find when looting which that you don't plan to use for yourself. Avoid practicing on your own clothes at lower levels, as you might destroy them in the process.  Sweatshirts are generally a safe practice item, as are Linux t-shirts of the Wrong distribution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tailoring and sewing apply to gear that is at least part cotton, wool, leather, fur, or Nomex.  Other gear (plastic, Kevlar, steel, etc) may require a welder or a soldering iron to repair or refit. Using a soldering iron or welder to repair items raises your Mechanics skill instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Trapping ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in setting and disarming [[traps]] safely and effectively. This skill does not affect the evasion of traps that are triggered (see dodge below). You can easily raise this skill by disarming various traps; some houses' residents have been known to rig their place, and Lab [[traps|goo pit]]s are plentiful in larger facilities. (Goo pits are not fatal.  Failing to disarm will cause you to be slimed, reducing your speed, but this effect does no physical damage). [[land mine|Land mine]]s require a high level of Trapping skill to successfully disarm, 7 is not overkill here.  That said, a single shrapnel to the head from an exploded [[land mine|landmine]] can easily kill you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trapping skill is about twice as effective at spotting traps as the perception stat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Dodge ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your ability to dodge an oncoming threat, be it an enemy's attack, a triggered trap, or a falling rock. This skill is also used in attempts to fall gracefully, and for other acrobatic feats.&lt;br /&gt;
Some books exist to teach Dodge, but in practice you'll pick it up on the job.  A point in chargen (buying two levels of Dodge) is generally considered a reasonable investment, thanks to the danger of live practice at low levels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
High levels (16+) of strength gives a dodge malus of 1, and low levels of strength (5 or lower) give a bonus of 1. &amp;lt;!-- character.cpp Character::reset_stats() --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Melee ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill and finesse in personal combat, both with and without a weapon. Higher levels can significantly increase the accuracy and effectiveness of your physical attacks. High melee skill protects melee weapons from being damaged by regular use&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
High melee skill (3) will grant you the ability to automatically find out any item's average damage and critical chance in melee. Sort of like dweomery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dexterity [[stat]] also affects your accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Bashing weapons ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in fighting with [[melee weapons|blunt weaponry]], from rocks and sticks to baseball bats and the butts of rifles. Skill increases damage and accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bashing weapons skill is less efficient at raising accuracy than other skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bashing weapons rely on critical hits which cause more than 225% of regular damage, stun and bypass 50% of target's armor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Bashing weapon damage cap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bashing weapons have a damage cap dependent on user's bashing weapon skill and strength: 2 * (Strength + skill). You cannot do more damage than this cap after damage is taken into account, This severely limits usefulness of heavy bashing weapons in combat, even for very strong characters. This is why a 40 damage [[sledge hammer]] might not do a lot of damage at low skill and strength levels.&amp;lt;!-- See melee.cpp:762 --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This does not apply to unarmed damage.{{verify|does this apply to bashing walls/furniture}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Cutting weapons==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in fighting with [[melee weapons|weaponry designed to cut]], hack and slash an opponent. Lower levels of skill increase accuracy and damage.{{verify|lower levels?}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Critical hits with cutting weapons bypass 5 armor and deal about 8% extra damage per skill level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the strongest weapons in game are cutting weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Piercing weapons==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in fighting with knives, spears and other such stabbing implements. Skill increases attack accuracy, damage and critical chance. Low skill in piercing weapons will often cause some of them to get [[Weapons_getting_stuck|stuck]] in the target.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Piercing weapons skill scales better than cutting weapons, but its usefulness is limited by weapon choice and by the difficulty of training it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Critical hits with piercing weapons bypass 33% of target's armor and deal extra 10% damage per skill level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Unarmed combat ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in hand-to-hand fighting. For the unskilled, it's a good way to get hurt, but those with enough practice can perform special blows and techniques to quickly dispatch enemies. Unarmed combat increases accuracy significantly more than weapon skills, but isn't efficient at raising damage directly. Instead it relies heavily on critical hits, which receive the same bonus to damage as bashing weapons (225% damage, extra strength scaling and 50% armor piercing).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Raising this skill allows you to use more powerful [[martial arts]] techniques. Upon reaching level 2 in this skill, you'll automatically learn [[Brawling]], but its techniques take considerably more ranks to activate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some weapons (such as [[brass knuckles]]) use unarmed weapon skill rather than bashing weapons skill for all calculations. When using those weapons, you still count as unarmed for most purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unarmed damage is bashing and follows the same rules with one exception: unarmed &amp;quot;weapon&amp;quot; damage is rolled randomly rather than being set to weapon damage. Bonus damage from unarmed weapons is applied before this roll. As a result per-hit damage of unarmed attacks tends to be low. Unarmed attacks make up for it with martial arts techniques, high accuracy and reliable critical hits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mutated survivors with usable natural weapons will use them more often at higher unarmed skill levels. This will happen even when wielding actual weapons. Mutated body parts (except claws, which simply boost unarmed damage) will not gain more damage through skills, only their frequency and accuracy is increased. Mutated body parts (except claws) can't hit critically.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Marksmanship ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your overall skill in using [[firearms]]. With higher levels, this general experience increases accuracy with any gun, but is secondary to practice with the type of gun in question.{{Verify|Does this skill matter for Archery?}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It also allows you to apply [[Firearms_modifications|modifications]] to your guns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Remember, the accuracy for any ranged attack is affected by the dexterity and perception [[stat]]s.'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Low perception will prevent training ranged skills with inaccurate weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to level this skill quickly, you could take ample amounts of ammunition into a field and practice firing at &amp;quot;slow, lumbering, or otherwise weak monsters&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;careful or precise shots&amp;quot;.  When in the target selction menu (f), pressing enter will fire the weapon from the hip, while &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;p&amp;quot; will allow for aimed shots that use the [[aim speed]] modifier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Archery ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in using bow weapons, from hand-carved self [[bows]] to complex hunting [[crossbows]]. Quiet and effective, however each bow has a minimum strength requirement to fire, and they are not terribly accurate over a long distance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The higher this skill is the lower the cost in moves to fire a bow will be. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can start training this skill either by reading [[Books#Archery_for_Kids|a magazine]] or by using any bow, composite bow or crossbow you find. Those are usually found in sporting goods stores or by deactivating or triggering traps (only for the [[traps#crossbow trap|crossbow trap]]). Alternatively you can make one with 1 Survival.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Launchers ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in using heavy weapons like rocket, grenade or missile launchers. These weapons have a variety of applications and may carry immense destructive power, but they are cumbersome and hard to manage.  Two books exist and it's a good idea to at least read your way to 1, if not 3, ranks before using a rocket launcher in a survival situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Throwing ==&lt;br /&gt;
Your skill in [[throwing]] objects over a distance. Skill increases accuracy, and at higher levels, the range of a throw.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Throwing costs 125 moving points.&amp;lt;!--  Each thrown item practice skill by 10 points.--&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An easy way to raise this skill is by gathering some rocks and throwing them at the evac shelter walls. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The damage and range of thrown weapons is affected by strength. Accuracy is affected by dexterity and perception.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Handguns ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Handguns]] have poor accuracy compared to rifles, but are usually quick to fire and reload faster than other guns. They are very effective at close quarters, though unsuited for long range engagement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accuracy for all ranged attacks is affected by your Dexterity [[stat]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Rifles ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Rifles]] have terrific range and accuracy compared to other firearms, but may be slow to fire and reload and tend to be very bulky. Fully automatic rifles can fire rapidly, but are harder to handle properly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accuracy also affected by dexterity [[stat]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Shotguns ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Shotguns]] are easy to shoot and can inflict massive damage, but their effectiveness and accuracy decline rapidly with range. Slugs can be loaded into shotguns to provide greater range, though they are somewhat inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This skill also includes the use of flamethrowers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accuracy also affected by dexterity [[stat]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Submachine guns ==&lt;br /&gt;
Comprised of an automatic rifle carbine designed to fire a pistol cartridge, [[submachine guns]] can reload and fire quickly, sometimes in bursts, but they are relatively inaccurate and may be prone to mechanical failures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accuracy is also affected by the dexterity [[stat]].&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;* One of the few aggressive water creatures, jawed terrors are extremely dangerous for any survivors swimming in their territories; [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, luckily they are rare, but you don't want to be caught swimming wherever these monsters may be, this is why boats are encouraged more after the cataclysm, they cannot leave their water habitats, this can be used to the players advantage when killing them.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;div&gt;A bleeding wound will cause the wounded body part to continually lose hit points, while leaving a bloody trail behind. If the bleeding body part is the torso or head you might eventually die from it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The enemy most often encountered with the ability to cause this type of wounds is the common [[black bear|bear]] and [[Wolf (monster)|wolf]] (check the item browser on the [[enemies]] page and look for the ones with the BLEED flag, since {{InlineVer|0.D}} the IMPALE tag also causes bleeding).&lt;br /&gt;

An bleeding bodypart is {{igs|red|c_red}} in the interface, and shows up in the {{k|@}} player info screen as 'Bleeding (body part)'. It is usually accompanied by some [[Pain|pain]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of [[0.F (Frank)]], bleeding goes up in stages depending of the extend of the damage and losing too much blood when bleeding can also lead to stages of [[hypovolemic shock]], monsters can now bleed too, and will lose health as they bleed, so try and use one or a few bullets to inflict heavy arterial bleeding and then finish them off with melee, or simply bleed them out easier with a [[Machete]], [[Kukri]] or [[Katana]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can stop a bleeding wound in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* [[first aid kit]]: Stops the bleeding automatically (before 0.D Danny)&lt;br /&gt;
* [[bandage]]: Stops the bleeding automatically&lt;br /&gt;
* [[hemostatic powder]]: Stops the bleeding automatically&lt;br /&gt;
* [[rag]]: Has a chance of stopping the bleeding; returns a [[blood soaked rag]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[cotton balls]]: Has  a chance of stopping the bleeding&lt;br /&gt;
* Cauterize with a [[soldering iron]], [[hotplate]], or both a knife (any kind) and [[lighter]]: Stops the bleeding automatically, at the cost of a steep rise in [[pain]] level.&lt;br /&gt;
* Put pressure on the wound by waiting with no weapon in hand, this prevents any further damage while doing so as long as the player is patient enough to wait a little to stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
It can be used for butchering, and also to cauterize wounds (along with a [[lighter]]). Due to it's low damage, it is more useful as a tool than a weapon, using this as a weapon is suicide, one may want to bring a [[makeshift knife]] alongside a pocket knife as a cutting weapon as the pocket knife has better butchering quality, and has fine cutting 1, where the makeshift knife doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;

{{quote|This is a large metal stand with slots on the side. You can set it somewhere through the construction menu and then set fires in it with no risk of spreading.}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A large stand, with a shallow bowl on top. Used for old-school fire sources.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It will still give off [[smoke]], but will prevent the [[fire]] from spreading, smoke will only spread from a brazier when the fuel starts burning, and does not travel far, it will eventually stop emitting smoke with the fire still burning, so simply stand back from the fire after freshly adding fuel or lighting the fire. Make sure to {{key|a}}ctivate it to place it down for this effect, not {{key|d}}rop it down. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to use a brazier:&lt;br /&gt;
 1. Deploy it {{key|a}}. If you didn't, the game will warn you when you go to set the fuel on fire.&lt;br /&gt;
 2. Drop fuel in brazier&lt;br /&gt;
 3. Set fuel in brazier on fire&lt;br /&gt;
 4. Enjoy and don't burn to death.&lt;br /&gt;
Don't worry about the order too much, as long as step 2 and 3 come last. You can set the fuel down and then set the brazier.&lt;br /&gt;
Found on either sides of the altar of churches. Brimstone not included. Flammable benches included.&lt;br /&gt;

Forest cabin and a tool shed. {{spoiler|You'll have to kill the former (undead) inhabitants if you want to settle here.}} Somewhat questionable to take shelter in, since they do not have any guaranteed water source as the [[LMOE shelter]] does. However, if you have/make a [[funnel]] and water container, [[river]], [[lake]] or [[swamp]] nearby alongside (as appropriate) a means to purify the water, then you could survive, as the rest of the forest has the natural resources to keep you alive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If staying in a cabin, players should note that it unless it has a [[cabin basement|basement]], which is rare in most cabins and quite dangerous due to [[cult]] monsters, cabins do not provide much protection from dangerous [[season]]s such as [[summer]] and [[winter]]; cabins will get very hot in summer and very cold during winter, therefore they will need to wear their weather protective clothing at all times in the cabin and keep blankets on their bed for winter.&lt;br /&gt;

LMOE stands for Last Man On Earth. It's the kind of shelter most real-life survivalists dream of (and some of them own).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has an underground area and forms an excellent shelter. It has its own water supply, in the form of a small water pond, and significant other supplies. If you get into a tight spot, it has a very defensible entrance and all doors are metal. There is a small food storage area with non-perishables as well as a handful of crates in the water area. There may also be wood-burning stoves in the water room as well as the bedroom. There is also a bathroom. You may also find equipment for survival inside, like tools. The entrance is easily distinguished from the surrounding forest, as there will be a small clearing around it, which is in turn surrounded by trees and shrubs. All in all, a wonderful place to set up for someone who wants to hide out in the forest or use this as a base for raiding nearby towns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being underground, LMOE shelters will also provide excellent protection from adverse weather conditions during dangerous [[season]]s such as [[summer]] and [[winter]], and will also protect from [[portal storms]] as of the current [[experimental]] version.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Firearms]] can be found in LMOE shelters. In most of them as of [[0.D (Danny)]], the rooms that contain the firearms are secret rooms disguised as a typical metal wall, so try and check every wall just in case you can get those sweet guns. Moreover, any guns tend to be high-caliber, including the powerful [[Desert Eagle .44]] usable by survivors with less strength.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of [[0.E (Ellison)]], there are also exercise machines in LMOE shelters. These machines can be used by survivors to build up their abilities; one can decide how strenuously to exercise on these machines.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;'''Spring''' is the first (in most [[scenarios]]), and one of the two safer seasons in Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, alongside [[autumn]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spring is followed by [[summer]], since summer is deadly for the unprepared, players should spend their first spring preparing for the harsh heat that is to come.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
==[[Weather]]==&lt;br /&gt;
During the first days of this [[season]], the weather is mainly flurries, as the days pass, the flurries tend to be replaced by drizzles by the afternoon, causing relative wetness if the player hasn't got good enough protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The temperature during the season tends to be cold, but gets milder and eventually warm as the days get closer to [[summer]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rain is a common weather occurrence during spring once the flurries die off, and thunder storms and lightning storms can occasionally happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Plants==&lt;br /&gt;
During spring, [[wild vegetables]] can be abundantly foraged from [[underbrush|underbrushes]] in [[forest]]s, [[wild herbs]], [[salsify]], [[bee balm]] and [[garlic]] can also be found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fruits do not grow from any bushes and trees during this season.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Early in the season, it will be too cold to plant seeds, but as the temperature warms up, [[farming]] can eventually be started.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Tips==&lt;br /&gt;
*See the [[The First Day|First Day Guide]] for tips on surviving the first day, which is almost always set in spring.&lt;br /&gt;
* Keep your winter clothes on during the start of the season, as it will still be relatively cold, winter clothes commonly have decent protection.&lt;br /&gt;
* A funnel is great during this season due to the abundance of rain. Don't forget to boil or purify it or risk a [[Food poisoning|food poisoning]]&lt;br /&gt;
*Try and gather or craft low warmth clothes for summer, and stockpile enough non-perishable/long lasting food and water for the later seasons, especially for winter.&lt;br /&gt;
*As the weather warms up ready for summer, change to cooler clothes so you don't [[Body temperature|overheat]].&lt;br /&gt;
*Don't bother too much eating the canned food you collect during this season, as fresh food is common enough during this season, and wild vegetables will start you off on keeping healthy. Save it for [[winter]], it's obviously not going to rot away, and you will have it ready to fall upon when dealing with health problems during winter.&lt;br /&gt;
*While drizzles are common and easy to endure with most articles of clothing in spring, the same can't be said for the occasional rain, thunder storms, and lightning storms, try and obtain a [[windbreaker]] for the early season, and a [[rain coat]] for the late season when it starts to warm up.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[[Category:Vehicles]]&lt;br /&gt;
{{sidebar/vehicles}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{tocr}}&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles, as their name suggests, provide a means for the survivor to move around much faster than on foot and if equipped with a trunk or box; allow the survivor to store his or her belongings in them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately due to the loud noises their engines make, they can quickly turn into a death-trap should you cruise through a town because of the huge amount of zombies their loudness attracts. Due to [[Acid_rain|acid rain]] and perhaps the neglect of their previous owners, most of the vehicles found in the streets are either damaged or broken, and this fact can quickly lead to the demise to the unlucky-enough driver of the car should his or her car break down in the middle of a horde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Common Locations ==&lt;br /&gt;
Automobiles and other kinds of vehicles can be found in many places. Towns are filled with vehicles of all kinds blocking the streets, usually wrecked. [[Garage]]s can spawn vehicles of various kinds, sometimes just chassis, but often drivable ones. [[Farm]]s have a good chance of housing a flatbed truck in decent condition. [[Road]]s contain large numbers of cars and trucks, and there's always wrecked cars next to [[gas station]]s. [[Sewage treatment]] plants and [[mall]]s usually have some vehicles in the parking area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the majority of vehicles you'll find won't be of too much use other than for spare parts, make a habit of checking all the ones you find, as there's always a few that you can drive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing you want to check when finding a new vehicle is the amount of [[gasoline]] or [[battery|batteries]] left (unless it's a bicycle) and if it has enough wheels to move around. In addition, you should check that the vehicle's controls, engine, and a seat are in working condition (any color other than gray).  That information is displayed when {{key|e}}xamining the vehicle. With enough fuel and wheels you can start driving that vehicle as soon as you find it, so you can move it to a safer place to be able to enhance it, repair it, refill it, etc without the threat of zombies and other beasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Default Vehicles ==&lt;br /&gt;
This is a list of some of the vehicles that you can find in the aforementioned locations (do note that these aren't all of the vehicles you can find currently):&lt;br /&gt;

You can also find incomplete versions of some of those vehicles inside garages. In that case they'll be displayed as &amp;quot;&amp;lt;name of vehicle&amp;gt; Chassis&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Actions ==&lt;br /&gt;
=== Refilling a vehicle ===&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles except shopping carts and bicycles (or custom vehicles with foot pedals) need some sort of combustible or power source in order to move. You can check how filled its gasoline tank or batteries are by looking at the fuel indicator. It's displayed as &amp;quot;E../F&amp;quot;, where the slash indicates how Empty or Full the gas tank or batteries are (close to E, empty, close to F, full). While mounted you can check it on the lower right corner of the screen. While dismounted you have to {{key|e}}xamine the vehicle to check it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Gasoline engines ====&lt;br /&gt;
[[Gasoline]] can be found in [[gas station]]s and some [[mine]]s and can be used to fill the gas tank of your vehicle in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''A)''' {{key|e}}xamine  a [[gasoline pump]]. When prompted say {{key|Y}}es to start pumping and then {{key|N}}o when asked if you want to pour it on the ground, then choose any empty container in your possession that is able to hold liquids. You can use anything for this purpose, from a [[plastic bottle]] (that only holds 400 units) to a [[steel jerrycan]] (which can hold up to 20000 units of gasoline). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a recipient filled with gasoline {{key|e}}xamine your vehicle and search for its gasoline tank. You can find the tank by moving around the vehicle parts by using the cursor keys. Finally Re{{key|f}}ill it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''B)''' Move your vehicle next to the gas pump and {{key|e}}xamine it. When asked if you want to fill your vehicle say {{key|Y}}es, and then press the direction where your vehicle is. Now you can either say {{key|Y}}es to automatically refill the vehicle until its gas tank is full or say {{key|N}}o and only fill it a bit. Whatever you decide depends on the situation, as filling a tank from empty to full can take a long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Diesel engines ====&lt;br /&gt;
Diesel engines are usually found in heavier vehicles such as semi trucks and military vehicles. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The player can get diesel from diesel pumps found in gas stations or from crafting diesel by learning the recipe from the book Biodiesel: Renewable Fuel Resource. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seems to work like a normal gas pump. Only difference is you need to park your car next to it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Electric engines ====&lt;br /&gt;
Require batteries and/or solar panels installed. Much quieter. Sound not affected by muffler.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can refill car batteries by having normal batteries in your inventory and using the vehicle menu and re{{key|f}}ill it, however you won't be able to reclaim the batteries later. (This has been removed in {{inlineVer|0.D}}). You can also use jumper cables to transfer power from a vehicle with energy in its battery to one without, and vehicles with alternators and running engines also produce power that can be transmitted through jumper cables. Car power is generally much easier to acquire in bulk than batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A 'storage battery' can be mounted in a 'storage battery case', these batteries you can switch out with minimal mechanics skill and no tools in {{inlineVer|0.C}}. In {{inlineVer|0.D}} storage batteries are heavy enough that you need a lifting tool to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Battery storage volume =====&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Different storage batteries have different volumes. All can be recharged by either having a running engine with an alternator, solar panels, or by using jumper cables.  Damaged batteries can't be repaired and may leach power from your vehicle over time.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==== Water Tanks ====&lt;br /&gt;
You are required to fill your water tank with clean water.&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to do this is to fill a steel or [[plastic jerrycan]] with water and use a [[water purifier]], it will clean the whole thing provided it has enough charge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Draining and Siphoning ===&lt;br /&gt;
You can drain any existing fuel, but not batteries, from any vehicle, provided that you have a [[rubber hose]] and some kind of [[Containers#Liquid containers|liquid container]]. If you have those items just approach a vehicle, {{k|e}}xamine it and then {{k|s}}iphon it. Once that is done, you'll be asked to pick a container for the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the water tank has a [[water faucet]] installed, you don't need the hose to drain it and can use the water directly for crafting, drinking and filling containers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Grabbing and dragging vehicles ===&lt;br /&gt;
You are able to drag any vehicle behind you as long as you're strong enough to move it. To do so, position yourself besides the vehicle, press {{k|G}} and select the direction the vehicle is. To release it, press {{k|G}} again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, only 1 tile carts can be dragged around without problems. Vehicles will break free from your grip when they change orientation (from/to diagonal) and the tile you were holding changes its position relative to you. They will also interrupt dragging when any of their tiles gets under you. This makes dragging bikes in anything but straight line rather tedious. Heavier vehicles (regular cars) are generally not draggable at all due to their weight - 35 strength isn't enough to move a regular &amp;quot;Car&amp;quot;-model car.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Hotwiring ===&lt;br /&gt;
Some cars still have working security system. Attempting to start such a car will have a chance to result in activating the alarm, activating the engine or both. Attempting to stop the alarm can damage the controls. Chances of success increase with mechanics skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Active alarm will make lots of noise and drain batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Vehicle controls ===&lt;br /&gt;
There are four (five in {{InlineVer|0.D}}) types of vehicle controls. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Controls]]''' are the regular controls that come equipped on virtually every vehicle. You sit on them to operate the vehicle, including all its accessories.  In {{InlineVer|0.D}}, standard controls do not let you operate accessories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Electronic control unit|Electronic controls]]''', you stand on them and activate them with ',' or 'e'. They do the things regular controls do, ''except drive''. They don't allow remote control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''({{InlineVer|0.D}} Only) [[Dashboard]]s''', you stand on them and activate them with ',' or 'e'. They do not allow you to drive, but they allow you to control accessories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Drive by wire controls]]''' allow you to stand on them and drive the vehicle like normal. They ''also'' allow remote control of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Robot driving unit|Robot controls]]''' install on a vehicle as a non-walkable tile. So you can't sit on them and control the vehicle. They can ''only be installed after other controls are already elsewhere on the vehicle.'' If the vehicle has just regular controls, then installing the robot controls makes it possible to remotely control the vehicle. If drive by wire controls are already installed, then installing robot controls adds nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Remote control ====&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles equipped with [[drive by wire controls]], or [[Robot driving unit]] can be controlled using [[remote vehicle controller]]. This can be utilized to make a ram, a mobile turret or just a distraction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles equipped with regular controls can still have functions activated at range, just can't be driven. For example, you can use the controller to cause a nearby car alarm to go off to distract the horde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cars that need to be hotwired will also require to be hacked to be remotely controlled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Jumper cables ===&lt;br /&gt;
Jumper cables can be used to connect any number of immobile vehicles into a network that shares energy. Whenever any vehicle in the network creates or consumes power, it will first try to charge/discharge own batteries and then charge/discharge nearest batteries in the network.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each cable along the way adds some power loss to this transfer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a vehicle moves, all jumper cables connected to it immediately disconnect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Turrets and guns ===&lt;br /&gt;
Turrets, when activated will fire at targets automatically. To manually fire a gun, stand on the location of the gun/turret, have your hands free and {{k|f}}ire. Follow the on-screen instructions.  You can also fire turrets from the vehicle's controls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Reloading turrets ====&lt;br /&gt;
Turrets will disable themselves automatically when they run out of ammunition. To reload them, you must {{k|D}}rop the corresponding [[ammo]] over them (as if you were &amp;quot;feeding&amp;quot; them). The turret location does not need a separate ammo space. If you cannot put the ammo in, the gun does not accept that type of ammo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, the ammo counter of a given turret will always display 1, regardless of the amount of ammo you've deposited on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In {{InlineVer|0.D}} you can no longer reload turrets by dropping ammo. You need to either stand on the turret and use {{k|r}}eload, or {{k|e}}xamine the turret and select reload.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Using Vehicle Storage ==&lt;br /&gt;
Stand next to the tile with Vehicle Storage and {{key|D}}rop items into it. You can use the {{key|e}}xamine key to look inside vehicle storage. Storage in a vehicle is per tile, not per vehicle. An empty tile does not show up as having storage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can store items in any seat, bed, box or trunk present in the vehicle. From all those, trunks and boxes are the ones which only purpose is to store cargo. While you can use the driver's seat for storage you won't be able to sit properly to drive your vehicle if it's too packed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the part used for storage has reached its maximum capacity any further items you place there will be dropped on the ground (you'll be warned about it). To recover those objects you have use the {{key|e}}xamine key, and select 'Get items on the ground'. Remember that if you don't pick those objects up again they'll be left lying there once you drive away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Storage volume ===&lt;br /&gt;
Cargo spaces have different displayed volumes. In {{InlineVer|0.C}}, volumes are measured in units 0.25L, while in {{InlineVer|0.D}}, they were measured in liters. The list shows {{inlineVer|0.C}} volumes first and liter measurements in parenthesis.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable sortable&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|+ Sortable table&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Floor Trunks and Cargo Spaces have the added benefit of not slowing you down as you pass over them, while the minifridge--if powered--keeps food fresh longer and makes several drinks taste better. Stow boards block LOS/Movement while also acting as storage space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Carrying Other Vehicles ===&lt;br /&gt;
{{InlineVer|0.D}} introduced Bike Racks, a vehicle component that allows you to carry other small vehicles externally.  Each bike rack can support a single tile of another vehicle, as long as every tile of the other vehicle is adjacent to a bike rack on the carrier vehicle and all the bike racks are in a single line.  That limits carried vehicles to being a single tile wide, though they can be of any length.  Carried vehicles merge with the carrier vehicle, though most parts of the carried vehicle are inaccessible while it is being carried.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A single tile wide vehicle can carry two single tile vehicles, one on each end, on bike racks, and still be eligible to be carried itself.  For instance, a bicycle could have two bike racks, and attach a welding cart to each one, and then the bicycle could be attached to the back of a Flatbed truck.  In the images below, &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; indicates a bike rack on the scooter, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; indicates a bike rack on the flatbed.  The racks are blue if empty and green if full.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
E'x'amine a bike rack when it is empty and an eligible vehicle is next to it to get the option load the bike rack. E'x'amine it again to when it is carrying a vehicle to  get the option to unload the bike rack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Smoke and noise ==&lt;br /&gt;
Active engine of any kind produces noise. An active gasoline or diesel engine also produces smoke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both noise and smoke are (not always directly) proportional to output of the engine. In case of multiple engines, load (power produced to power utilized) on each engine is equal. Smoke produced is a sum of smoke from all smoking (gas/diesel) engines. Noise level isn't summed - only the loudest engine counts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gas, diesel and plasma engines benefit from a muffler, which reduces the noise and smoke from those engines to 60%. Mufflers don't use any extra power. If a muffler exists, all smoke will be spewed from it rather than from engines producing it. Only the best muffler (the least damaged one) will be used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Noise levels can depend on both current power (c) and maximum power (m):&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|+ Sortable table&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! scope=&amp;quot;col&amp;quot; | Kind !! scope=&amp;quot;col&amp;quot; | Noise&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Gas/diesel || 15*c + 3*m + 5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Plasma || 9*c + 1&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Muscle || 5*c&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Electric || 3*c&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
Numbers (c and m) in the equations above are relative and actually translating them from/to user readable variables is not that simple. Exact values are: m = power_to_epower(part_power(p, true)) / 40000.0, c = m * load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally all driven vehicles have a low cap on noise of velocity_in_mph/5 or in metric velocity_in_kmh/11.2, which translates (roughly) to tiles_per_turn*1.8.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To put the numbers above into a perspective:&lt;br /&gt;
* A medium-sized electric engine thrusting at full power produces 1 noise, large one 9 noise&lt;br /&gt;
* A vehicle moving 3 tiles per turn produces 5 or 6 noise (unless its engines produce more)&lt;br /&gt;
* An idling 15 liter gas engine with a muffler produces 20 noise&lt;br /&gt;
* A fully utilized foot crank produces 2 noise&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicles and the environment ==&lt;br /&gt;
Currently there is no air-conditioning/heater system inside cars. Cars automatically protect you from the environment. If you are inside a car with sides, and a roof, you get some heat/cold protection, and some rain protection. No need to turn on any air conditioning. If parts of the car are damaged they will work less well as insulation and will let some of the outside through. So damaged roofs will get you wet, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;
The terrain also affects your vehicle's speed, vehicle with less than a 100% off-road stat will suffer penalties when driving in any terrain other than asphalt and sidewalks, you can increase the off-road stat by adding more wheels to your vehicle or by using bigger wheels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle processing metagame ==&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles in submaps loaded into memory are processed. This means that their fuel is consumed (if engines are on), solars charge batteries (if the car is above ground and in sunlight), parts consume power, alternators connected to active engines charge batteries etc. Vehicles outside those submaps are effectively frozen in time. Vehicles on loaded submaps but outside the [[reality bubble]] will not move, though they are still processed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A submap is loaded when it gets into [[reality bubble]]. It is unloaded when the game is saved (note: includes quicksaves and autosaves!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles connected with jumper cables are an exception - one such vehicle in [[reality bubble]] will cause all others to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When trying to maximize solar power output, sleep near your car, on the same z-level and/or with autosave disabled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Fixed in {{inlineVer|0.D}} - vehicle solar panels now function regardless of player distance/z-level)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Damage effects ==&lt;br /&gt;
When a part is damaged it works less efficiently. As you would expect. Damaged engines don't always start, damaged batteries and fuel/water tanks leak. Alternators and solar panels are less efficient. So repair that damage!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Boats ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Boat hulls do not provide buoyancy inherently. Adding boat hulls to your vehicle increases the amount of your vehicle that is watertight, and effectively increases the height of your vehicle's watertight hull - ie, the distance between the bottom of your vehicle and the level at which water can pour into your vehicle when your vehicle is in water. Buoyancy is calculated from displacement: the area of your vehicle's footprint multiplied by the watertight hull height. If your vehicle's displacement is less than its weight, your vehicle will float.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By adding boat hulls, it is possible to create a floating vehicle. Once a hull is added, there are several values calculated in order to determine if the vehicle is able to float or not:&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Coverage''': number of tiles with boat hulls divided by the total number of tiles (not displayed ingame)&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Sealed hull height''': 0.3m + 0.5m * coverage (not displayed ingame)&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Draft''': Determined by weight, coverage, length and width of the vehicle (displayed in the vehicle interaction window). If draft is larger than the sealed hull height, the vehicle will not be able to float; which means that vehicles with a draft larger than 0.8 will never be able to float. Draft is determined by 12/7 * vehicle weight / coverage percent / the length and width of the vehicle - it's actually a calculation of how much water the vehicle will displace via the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle Archimedes principle] assuming the vehicle has something of a boat-like underwater hull.  Note that the weight of the vehicle takes the weight of the cargo and the weight of the passengers into account - a vehicle that has a draft of just under 0.8 might sink if cargo or a passenger is added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lighter materials will make it easier for a boat to float, and more-durable ones help avoid risk of the vehicle sinking.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[[Category:Vehicles]]&lt;br /&gt;
{{sidebar/vehicles}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{tocr}}&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles, as their name suggests, provide a means for the survivor to move around much faster than on foot and if equipped with a trunk or box; allow the survivor to store his or her belongings in them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately due to the loud noises their engines make, they can quickly turn into a death-trap should you cruise through a town because of the huge amount of zombies their loudness attracts. Due to [[Acid_rain|acid rain]] and perhaps the neglect of their previous owners, most of the vehicles found in the streets are either damaged or broken, and this fact can quickly lead to the demise to the unlucky-enough driver of the car should his or her car break down in the middle of a horde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Common Locations ==&lt;br /&gt;
Automobiles and other kinds of vehicles can be found in many places. Towns are filled with vehicles of all kinds blocking the streets, usually wrecked. [[Garage]]s can spawn vehicles of various kinds, sometimes just chassis, but often drivable ones. [[Farm]]s have a good chance of housing a flatbed truck in decent condition. [[Road]]s contain large numbers of cars and trucks, and there's always wrecked cars next to [[gas station]]s. [[Sewage treatment]] plants and [[mall]]s usually have some vehicles in the parking area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the majority of vehicles you'll find won't be of too much use other than for spare parts, make a habit of checking all the ones you find, as there's always a few that you can drive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing you want to check when finding a new vehicle is the amount of [[gasoline]] or [[battery|batteries]] left (unless it's a bicycle) and if it has enough wheels to move around. In addition, you should check that the vehicle's controls, engine, and a seat are in working condition (any color other than gray).  That information is displayed when {{key|e}}xamining the vehicle. With enough fuel and wheels you can start driving that vehicle as soon as you find it, so you can move it to a safer place to be able to enhance it, repair it, refill it, etc without the threat of zombies and other beasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Default Vehicles ==&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
You can also find incomplete versions of some of those vehicles inside garages. In that case they'll be displayed as &amp;quot;&amp;lt;name of vehicle&amp;gt; Chassis&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Actions ==&lt;br /&gt;
=== Refilling a vehicle ===&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles except shopping carts and bicycles (or custom vehicles with foot pedals) need some sort of combustible or power source in order to move. You can check how filled its gasoline tank or batteries are by looking at the fuel indicator. It's displayed as &amp;quot;E../F&amp;quot;, where the slash indicates how Empty or Full the gas tank or batteries are (close to E, empty, close to F, full). While mounted you can check it on the lower right corner of the screen. While dismounted you have to {{key|e}}xamine the vehicle to check it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Gasoline engines ====&lt;br /&gt;
[[Gasoline]] can be found in [[gas station]]s and some [[mine]]s and can be used to fill the gas tank of your vehicle in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''A)''' {{key|e}}xamine  a [[gasoline pump]]. When prompted say {{key|Y}}es to start pumping and then {{key|N}}o when asked if you want to pour it on the ground, then choose any empty container in your possession that is able to hold liquids. You can use anything for this purpose, from a [[plastic bottle]] (that only holds 400 units) to a [[steel jerrycan]] (which can hold up to 20000 units of gasoline). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a recipient filled with gasoline {{key|e}}xamine your vehicle and search for its gasoline tank. You can find the tank by moving around the vehicle parts by using the cursor keys. Finally Re{{key|f}}ill it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''B)''' Move your vehicle next to the gas pump and {{key|e}}xamine it. When asked if you want to fill your vehicle say {{key|Y}}es, and then press the direction where your vehicle is. Now you can either say {{key|Y}}es to automatically refill the vehicle until its gas tank is full or say {{key|N}}o and only fill it a bit. Whatever you decide depends on the situation, as filling a tank from empty to full can take a long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Diesel engines ====&lt;br /&gt;
Diesel engines are usually found in heavier vehicles such as semi trucks and military vehicles. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The player can get diesel from diesel pumps found in gas stations or from crafting diesel by learning the recipe from the book Biodiesel: Renewable Fuel Resource. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seems to work like a normal gas pump. Only difference is you need to park your car next to it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Electric engines ====&lt;br /&gt;
Require batteries and/or solar panels installed. Much quieter. Sound not affected by muffler.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can refill car batteries by having normal batteries in your inventory and using the vehicle menu and re{{key|f}}ill it, however you won't be able to reclaim the batteries later. (This has been removed in {{inlineVer|0.D}}). You can also use jumper cables to transfer power from a vehicle with energy in its battery to one without, and vehicles with alternators and running engines also produce power that can be transmitted through jumper cables. Car power is generally much easier to acquire in bulk than batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A 'storage battery' can be mounted in a 'storage battery case', these batteries you can switch out with minimal mechanics skill and no tools in {{inlineVer|0.C}}. In {{inlineVer|0.D}} storage batteries are heavy enough that you need a lifting tool to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Battery storage volume =====&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Different storage batteries have different volumes. All can be recharged by either having a running engine with an alternator, solar panels, or by using jumper cables.  Damaged batteries can't be repaired and may leach power from your vehicle over time.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Water Tanks ====&lt;br /&gt;
You are required to fill your water tank with clean water.&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to do this is to fill a steel or [[plastic jerrycan]] with water and use a [[water purifier]], it will clean the whole thing provided it has enough charge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Draining and Siphoning ===&lt;br /&gt;
You can drain any existing fuel, but not batteries, from any vehicle, provided that you have a [[rubber hose]] and some kind of [[Containers#Liquid containers|liquid container]]. If you have those items just approach a vehicle, {{k|e}}xamine it and then {{k|s}}iphon it. Once that is done, you'll be asked to pick a container for the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the water tank has a [[water faucet]] installed, you don't need the hose to drain it and can use the water directly for crafting, drinking and filling containers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Grabbing and dragging vehicles ===&lt;br /&gt;
You are able to drag any vehicle behind you as long as you're strong enough to move it. To do so, position yourself besides the vehicle, press {{k|G}} and select the direction the vehicle is. To release it, press {{k|G}} again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, only 1 tile carts can be dragged around without problems. Vehicles will break free from your grip when they change orientation (from/to diagonal) and the tile you were holding changes its position relative to you. They will also interrupt dragging when any of their tiles gets under you. This makes dragging bikes in anything but straight line rather tedious. Heavier vehicles (regular cars) are generally not draggable at all due to their weight - 35 strength isn't enough to move a regular &amp;quot;Car&amp;quot;-model car.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Hotwiring ===&lt;br /&gt;
Some cars still have working security system. Attempting to start such a car will have a chance to result in activating the alarm, activating the engine or both. Attempting to stop the alarm can damage the controls. Chances of success increase with mechanics skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Active alarm will make lots of noise and drain batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Vehicle controls ===&lt;br /&gt;
There are four (five in {{InlineVer|0.D}}) types of vehicle controls. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Controls]]''' are the regular controls that come equipped on virtually every vehicle. You sit on them to operate the vehicle, including all its accessories.  In {{InlineVer|0.D}}, standard controls do not let you operate accessories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Electronic control unit|Electronic controls]]''', you stand on them and activate them with ',' or 'e'. They do the things regular controls do, ''except drive''. They don't allow remote control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''({{InlineVer|0.D}} Only) [[Dashboard]]s''', you stand on them and activate them with ',' or 'e'. They do not allow you to drive, but they allow you to control accessories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Drive by wire controls]]''' allow you to stand on them and drive the vehicle like normal. They ''also'' allow remote control of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Robot driving unit|Robot controls]]''' install on a vehicle as a non-walkable tile. So you can't sit on them and control the vehicle. They can ''only be installed after other controls are already elsewhere on the vehicle.'' If the vehicle has just regular controls, then installing the robot controls makes it possible to remotely control the vehicle. If drive by wire controls are already installed, then installing robot controls adds nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Remote control ====&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles equipped with [[drive by wire controls]], or [[Robot driving unit]] can be controlled using [[remote vehicle controller]]. This can be utilized to make a ram, a mobile turret or just a distraction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles equipped with regular controls can still have functions activated at range, just can't be driven. For example, you can use the controller to cause a nearby car alarm to go off to distract the horde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cars that need to be hotwired will also require to be hacked to be remotely controlled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Jumper cables ===&lt;br /&gt;
Jumper cables can be used to connect any number of immobile vehicles into a network that shares energy. Whenever any vehicle in the network creates or consumes power, it will first try to charge/discharge own batteries and then charge/discharge nearest batteries in the network.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each cable along the way adds some power loss to this transfer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a vehicle moves, all jumper cables connected to it immediately disconnect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Turrets and guns ===&lt;br /&gt;
Turrets, when activated will fire at targets automatically. To manually fire a gun, stand on the location of the gun/turret, have your hands free and {{k|f}}ire. Follow the on-screen instructions.  You can also fire turrets from the vehicle's controls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Reloading turrets ====&lt;br /&gt;
Turrets will disable themselves automatically when they run out of ammunition. To reload them, you must {{k|D}}rop the corresponding [[ammo]] over them (as if you were &amp;quot;feeding&amp;quot; them). The turret location does not need a separate ammo space. If you cannot put the ammo in, the gun does not accept that type of ammo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, the ammo counter of a given turret will always display 1, regardless of the amount of ammo you've deposited on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In {{InlineVer|0.D}} you can no longer reload turrets by dropping ammo. You need to either stand on the turret and use {{k|r}}eload, or {{k|e}}xamine the turret and select reload.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Using Vehicle Storage ==&lt;br /&gt;
Stand next to the tile with Vehicle Storage and {{key|D}}rop items into it. You can use the {{key|e}}xamine key to look inside vehicle storage. Storage in a vehicle is per tile, not per vehicle. An empty tile does not show up as having storage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can store items in any seat, bed, box or trunk present in the vehicle. From all those, trunks and boxes are the ones which only purpose is to store cargo. While you can use the driver's seat for storage you won't be able to sit properly to drive your vehicle if it's too packed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the part used for storage has reached its maximum capacity any further items you place there will be dropped on the ground (you'll be warned about it). To recover those objects you have use the {{key|e}}xamine key, and select 'Get items on the ground'. Remember that if you don't pick those objects up again they'll be left lying there once you drive away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Storage volume ===&lt;br /&gt;
Cargo spaces have different displayed volumes. In {{InlineVer|0.C}}, volumes are measured in units 0.25L, while in {{InlineVer|0.D}}, they were measured in liters. The list shows {{inlineVer|0.C}} volumes first and liter measurements in parenthesis.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable sortable&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Floor Trunks and Cargo Spaces have the added benefit of not slowing you down as you pass over them, while the minifridge--if powered--keeps food fresh longer and makes several drinks taste better. Stow boards block LOS/Movement while also acting as storage space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Carrying Other Vehicles ===&lt;br /&gt;
{{InlineVer|0.D}} introduced Bike Racks, a vehicle component that allows you to carry other small vehicles externally.  Each bike rack can support a single tile of another vehicle, as long as every tile of the other vehicle is adjacent to a bike rack on the carrier vehicle and all the bike racks are in a single line.  That limits carried vehicles to being a single tile wide, though they can be of any length.  Carried vehicles merge with the carrier vehicle, though most parts of the carried vehicle are inaccessible while it is being carried.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A single tile wide vehicle can carry two single tile vehicles, one on each end, on bike racks, and still be eligible to be carried itself.  For instance, a bicycle could have two bike racks, and attach a welding cart to each one, and then the bicycle could be attached to the back of a Flatbed truck.  In the images below, &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; indicates a bike rack on the scooter, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; indicates a bike rack on the flatbed.  The racks are blue if empty and green if full.&lt;br /&gt;

E'x'amine a bike rack when it is empty and an eligible vehicle is next to it to get the option load the bike rack. E'x'amine it again to when it is carrying a vehicle to  get the option to unload the bike rack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Smoke and noise ==&lt;br /&gt;
Active engine of any kind produces noise. An active gasoline or diesel engine also produces smoke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both noise and smoke are (not always directly) proportional to output of the engine. In case of multiple engines, load (power produced to power utilized) on each engine is equal. Smoke produced is a sum of smoke from all smoking (gas/diesel) engines. Noise level isn't summed - only the loudest engine counts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gas, diesel and plasma engines benefit from a muffler, which reduces the noise and smoke from those engines to 60%. Mufflers don't use any extra power. If a muffler exists, all smoke will be spewed from it rather than from engines producing it. Only the best muffler (the least damaged one) will be used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Noise levels can depend on both current power (c) and maximum power (m):&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|+ Sortable table&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! scope=&amp;quot;col&amp;quot; | Kind !! scope=&amp;quot;col&amp;quot; | Noise&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Gas/diesel || 15*c + 3*m + 5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Plasma || 9*c + 1&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Muscle || 5*c&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Electric || 3*c&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
Numbers (c and m) in the equations above are relative and actually translating them from/to user readable variables is not that simple. Exact values are: m = power_to_epower(part_power(p, true)) / 40000.0, c = m * load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally all driven vehicles have a low cap on noise of velocity_in_mph/5 or in metric velocity_in_kmh/11.2, which translates (roughly) to tiles_per_turn*1.8.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To put the numbers above into a perspective:&lt;br /&gt;
* A medium-sized electric engine thrusting at full power produces 1 noise, large one 9 noise&lt;br /&gt;
* A vehicle moving 3 tiles per turn produces 5 or 6 noise (unless its engines produce more)&lt;br /&gt;
* An idling 15 liter gas engine with a muffler produces 20 noise&lt;br /&gt;
* A fully utilized foot crank produces 2 noise&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicles and the environment ==&lt;br /&gt;
Currently there is no air-conditioning/heater system inside cars. Cars automatically protect you from the environment. If you are inside a car with sides, and a roof, you get some heat/cold protection, and some rain protection. No need to turn on any air conditioning. If parts of the car are damaged they will work less well as insulation and will let some of the outside through. So damaged roofs will get you wet, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;
The terrain also affects your vehicle's speed, vehicle with less than a 100% off-road stat will suffer penalties when driving in any terrain other than asphalt and sidewalks, you can increase the off-road stat by adding more wheels to your vehicle or by using bigger wheels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Vehicle processing metagame ==&lt;br /&gt;
All vehicles in submaps loaded into memory are processed. This means that their fuel is consumed (if engines are on), solars charge batteries (if the car is above ground and in sunlight), parts consume power, alternators connected to active engines charge batteries etc. Vehicles outside those submaps are effectively frozen in time. Vehicles on loaded submaps but outside the [[reality bubble]] will not move, though they are still processed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A submap is loaded when it gets into [[reality bubble]]. It is unloaded when the game is saved (note: includes quicksaves and autosaves!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vehicles connected with jumper cables are an exception - one such vehicle in [[reality bubble]] will cause all others to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When trying to maximize solar power output, sleep near your car, on the same z-level and/or with autosave disabled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Fixed in {{inlineVer|0.D}} - vehicle solar panels now function regardless of player distance/z-level)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Damage effects ==&lt;br /&gt;
When a part is damaged it works less efficiently. As you would expect. Damaged engines don't always start, damaged batteries and fuel/water tanks leak. Alternators and solar panels are less efficient. So repair that damage!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Boats ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Boat hulls do not provide buoyancy inherently. Adding boat hulls to your vehicle increases the amount of your vehicle that is watertight, and effectively increases the height of your vehicle's watertight hull - ie, the distance between the bottom of your vehicle and the level at which water can pour into your vehicle when your vehicle is in water. Buoyancy is calculated from displacement: the area of your vehicle's footprint multiplied by the watertight hull height. If your vehicle's displacement is less than its weight, your vehicle will float.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By adding boat hulls, it is possible to create a floating vehicle. Once a hull is added, there are several values calculated in order to determine if the vehicle is able to float or not:&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Coverage''': number of tiles with boat hulls divided by the total number of tiles (not displayed ingame)&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Sealed hull height''': 0.3m + 0.5m * coverage (not displayed ingame)&lt;br /&gt;
* '''Draft''': Determined by weight, coverage, length and width of the vehicle (displayed in the vehicle interaction window). If draft is larger than the sealed hull height, the vehicle will not be able to float; which means that vehicles with a draft larger than 0.8 will never be able to float. Draft is determined by 12/7 * vehicle weight / coverage percent / the length and width of the vehicle - it's actually a calculation of how much water the vehicle will displace via the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle Archimedes principle] assuming the vehicle has something of a boat-like underwater hull.  Note that the weight of the vehicle takes the weight of the cargo and the weight of the passengers into account - a vehicle that has a draft of just under 0.8 might sink if cargo or a passenger is added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lighter materials will make it easier for a boat to float, and more-durable ones help avoid risk of the vehicle sinking.&lt;br /&gt;

 |description=SoyPelusa ran a highly successful crowdfunding campaign for this protein bar. A person can live on one of these bars, three times a day, presumably forever. After backers received their product, a single flaw was found: most consumers found starvation preferable to the flavor. Warehouses of the product went unsold as the company went bankrupt, providing the perfect opportunity for FEMA to scoop them up and stock the evac shelters. Now, you hold a piece of famous crowdfunding history in your hands. How exciting.&lt;br /&gt;

* You can't afford to be picky during the apocalypse, and these bars will not rot EVER after the Cataclysm, so try and save these bars for [[winter]]; have some preserved or canned food to have alongside it, so you don't become down from it, and eat it either before you sleep or when you have just woken up, it's calories will serve you well when you really need them...&lt;br /&gt;

 |description=SoyPelusa ran a highly successful crowdfunding campaign for this protein bar. A person can live on one of these bars, three times a day, presumably forever. After backers received their product, a single flaw was found: most consumers found starvation preferable to the flavor. Warehouses of the product went unsold as the company went bankrupt, providing the perfect opportunity for FEMA to scoop them up and stock the evac shelters. Now, you hold a piece of famous crowdfunding history in your hands. How exciting.&lt;br /&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mrstickman1997: Removed misinformation, the 999 pain does NOT kill, but the pain and limb breaking causes awful effects that may as well have killed you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[[Spores (disease)|Spores]] is a [[effects|disease]] that can be acquired while standing adjacent to [[fungaloid]]s or other fungal infected monsters without good environmental protection on your entire body (except hands and feet). Flying [[spore cloud]]s are actually harmless by themselves and do not cause this infection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The disease has a minimal duration of 30 turns and a 3.(3)% chance per turn to settle in a character's body and grow into Fungal Parasite. Spore infection cannot be healed except with aid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite the status description it actually gives a -15 [[speed]] penalty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Fungal Parasite ==&lt;br /&gt;
Fungal parasites result from a successful case of spore infection, getting fungal haze in one's eyes or mouth, direct injection by fungal tendrils, or (rarely) from direct planar passage {{spoiler|0.01% per turn of telesickness}}. In contrast to other diseases, this one gets worse over time, and does not go away on its own, making it especially deadly to contract. The disease decreases the character's [[movement points]] by 10&amp;lt;!-- p.moves-=10 right in dis_effect() instead of disease_speed_boost(), need to research effects? --&amp;gt;, and strength and dexterity by 1. Fungal parasite can be detected by [[Blood Analysis]] (disease is not shown in character status screen) and cured by [[Blood Filter]] bionics, [[antifungal drug]], or (not guaranteed to work) [[fungicide]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First hour symptoms: &lt;br /&gt;
* Heavy coughing ([[noise]] of 12) and [[Pain|pain]] +1 with 0.6% chance per turn (0.3% for characters with [[traits#Poison Resistant|Poison Resistant]]).&lt;br /&gt;
* Messages about nausea or taste of mushrooms, both with 1% chance per turn (0.5% for PR).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One to six hours symptoms:&lt;br /&gt;
* Spasm, which hurts torso for 5 HP and takes out 100 movement points, with 0.1(6)% chance per turn (0.(1)% with Poison Resistant).&lt;br /&gt;
* Distinctive vomiting (described as &amp;quot;vomiting a thick gray goop&amp;quot;), which takes out 200 movement points and adds 50 [[hunger]] and 68 thirst, with a 0.05% chance (0.6% with [[traits#Weak Stomach|Weak Stomach]], or 0.125% chance with [[mutation#Nausea|Nausea]]) per turn (0.02%, 0.04%, or 0.07% with Poison Resistant).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Full symptoms (after 6 hours):&lt;br /&gt;
* Fungaloid spores coughing, which takes out 500 movement points and happens silently (in contrary to monsters variant), with 0.01% chance per turn (0.0(5)% with Poison Resistant).&lt;br /&gt;
* Fungus breaks both arms (no matter their hp) and causes 999 pain with 0.1(6)% chance per turn (0.0125% with Poison Resistant). While this does NOT kill the player, the pain makes them barely able to move quickly, brings down all their stats to 0 and disallows them from holding weapons.&lt;br /&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mrstickman1997: Fungal parasites increase it by 999 in late stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are 9 perceivable levels of pain:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* No pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Minimal pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Mild pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Moderate pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Distracting pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Distressing pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Unmanageable pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Intense pain&lt;br /&gt;
* Severe pain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
High levels of pain can result in stat penalties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''How does it increase?''' (Not a complete list)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* By taking damage from enemies&lt;br /&gt;
* Walking over certain tiles such as rubble or fire&lt;br /&gt;
* Diseases or conditions such as infected bite wounds&lt;br /&gt;
* Failed implanting of bionics&lt;br /&gt;
* Certain weather such as acid rain&lt;br /&gt;
* Rapid physiological changes from [[mutation]] can be painful&lt;br /&gt;
* Being overburdened (can easily result from strength being lowered due to pain)&lt;br /&gt;
* Having one's arms broken by a late stage [[fungal parasite]], causing 999 pain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''How does it decrease?'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Waiting for it to go down (Taking painkillers speeds up this process)&lt;br /&gt;
* Using Bionics&lt;br /&gt;
* Adrenaline can temporarily alleviate the effects of pain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Certain mutations also speed up pain loss and resistance to pain)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Painkillers ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Painkiller''' is a value indicating internal effects working against pain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Default value: 0 | Max value: 240&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''How does it increase?'''&lt;br /&gt;
* By taking certain [[Comestibles/Meds|Meds]]&lt;br /&gt;
* By drinking [[alcohol]] (stronger is better), unless you [[Alcohol Metabolism|metabolize it]]&lt;br /&gt;
* Tiny amounts can be gained by smoking [[Cannabis|weed]]&lt;br /&gt;
* Traits like [[Chemical Imbalance]] and [[Schizophrenic]] can randomly increase it&lt;br /&gt;
* If negative, it will increase by 1 every 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''How does it decrease?'''&lt;br /&gt;
* If positive, it will decrease by 1 every 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
* Addiction to painkillers (1 per turn at 25+ intensity, otherwise 1 per (100 - 4 * intensity) turns)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Effects'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is subtracted from pain in pretty much every situation where pain is involved in any way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kills you instantly if you get it above 240.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Decreases speed, but less so than the pain it prevents would cause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Maximum painkiller effect'''&lt;br /&gt;
* aspirin - 15&lt;br /&gt;
* codeine - 49&lt;br /&gt;
* heroin - 92&lt;br /&gt;
* morphine - 62&lt;br /&gt;
*oxycodone - 62&lt;br /&gt;
* poppy painkiller - 47&lt;br /&gt;
* tramadol - 40&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;* These nasty creatures can be found in underground areas like [[sewer]]s, [[subway]]s, and even [[basement]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
* Unlike [[zombies]], which do so by chance, a single successful bite from the sewer gator can lead to an instant deep [[bite wound]], which can lead to infection, sand even there, a single attack can also take out a huge chunk of the player's HP, sewer gators are not to be taken lightly.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;br /&gt;
It can't shoot lightning, but it emits a constant electric field around itself that will rapidly kill you if you're too close, shorts out electronics near it, and ignites flammable liquid near it. {{spoiler|That includes gas pumps.}} Luckily, they are rather slow, so you can lead them to some place where they won't be a problem, run away, or simply take your time shooting them from a safe distance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{{spoiler|Tossing an EMP grenade or otherwise EMPing the husk will stop its electrical field for about 5 minutes.}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{{spoiler|Lightning can strike the husk, which causes its field to be massive, it to move twice as fast, and it to emit constant loud buzzing. This usually kills other zombies near it, but makes it hugely dangerous for the day or so that it lasts.}}&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mrstickman1997: /* Scavenging for guns and ammo */ Added a little more in the way of tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Scavenging is the primary method of obtaining whatever goodies you want after the cataclysm. It may be a basic gameplay mechanic, but it's the basis for survival and can be very challenging. This guide shows how to get in, get the stuff you need, and get out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Where to scavenge==&lt;br /&gt;
The [[city]] is where most players might consider first for scavenging. However, don't let all that loot lure you in too soon in your play; the city is the epicenter of the zombie hordes. If you don't have a plan or the equipment to defend yourself or break and enter, you will end up seriously injured or dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[countryside]] also has places to scavenge. Scavenging here can train your skills and provide enough resources for you to prepare to venture into the city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Important items==&lt;br /&gt;
* A [[crowbar]] is a quintessential scavenger's tool. This will help you pry those pesky doors and windows open, making much less noise than simply breaking them. Do be warned that prying a window has a chance to break the glass instead of opening it. It's also a decent melee option, just beware of electric enemies.&lt;br /&gt;
* A [[makeshift lockpick]] or [[locksmith kit]] is essential for [[gun store]]s, as each is used to pick the lock on the metal door. These can also pick bar doors in places like the [[prison]] or the [[necropolis]] [[sewer]]. Also provides a quiet, if time consuming, way to enter any locked door. If you're using makeshift lockpicks, bring multiple, as they break very frequently with low skill.&lt;br /&gt;
* A [[firearm]]. If scavenging, you are not exactly focused on combat, but if a dangerous monster corners you, having a gun to kill it and escape may just save your bacon. Just remember to book it; noise attracts death.&lt;br /&gt;
* A hacksaw can be used to saw through bars and bar doors, they are essential for getting into some [[bank]]s to get to the terminal behind them, and can also be used to saw the bars off gun store windows to get inside that way.&lt;br /&gt;
* A [[Melee Weapons|melee weapon]] for quietly killing zombies. [[Machete]] is a good one due to its light weight, low volume, and decent butchering quality.&lt;br /&gt;
* A [[butcher|butchering tool]] for butchering corpses (if you're not pulping them) and if you're not bringing a machete. [[Butcher knife]] should suffice.&lt;br /&gt;
* A [[gas mask]] is very useful. Some houses may be infested with [[bloated zombie]]s. Their [[toxic gas]] can linger for quite some time in buildings. [[smoker zombie]]s can also be found in [[basement]]s, especially well stocked ones, alongside [[survivor zombie]]s. If you [[Smoke (disease)|inhale the smoke]] and get attacked by them, you'll die coughing and sputtering, your stamina drained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==The first scrounge==&lt;br /&gt;
No matter where you start, there is always a set of important items you should get before you settle into wherever you're going to stay.&lt;br /&gt;
If you don't have any storage clothing , craft a [[bindle]] first, if you don't have a knife, craft one, break a oven, locker or display rack with a [[rock]] and use the chunks of steel or scrap metal, disassemble some long string and use it with the rock to craft a [[makeshift knife]], after crafting the knife, butcher the sheet from the curtain, and use the rags and stick to make the bindle. If you find or craft a sewing item, you should also take apart some curtains and craft a [[pouch]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now you have some storage, check your inventory. Do you have a firestarting tool? If not, you may want to search houses, dumpsters, bins or maybe some zombies for [[lighter]]s, [[matchbook]]s and [[refillable lighter]]s. You can craft an [[electric firestarter]] that uses batteries later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next up, find a cooking tool such as a [[pot]], you can find these without much trouble in [[house]]s on the edge of the [[cities]] on top of ovens or in cupboards. Searching a couple kitchens should net you a pot of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, find a water container, you need one before you set off to find a base, if it has a drink in it, the better. Plastic bottles with drinks can easily be found in fridges. If you want to move more water at once, try dumping out a gallon jug from a kitchen or bathroom and filling it with water to purify.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though not overly important before settling in a base, you may want to find an [[infection]] treatment, such as [[disinfectant]] to prevent deep wounds from turning into infections, or [[antibiotic]]s to clear the infection itself. Getting bit and being unable to treat it before you settle in is certain death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now you have got all this stuff, don't get greedy yet. You ought to get out of the city and find a safe place to settle as your home base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[funnel|Funnels]] are useful as they allow you to collect rainwater but they're heavily hamstringed by the fact that they require rains to collect water, especially if you don't have several of them. Consider living near a body of water be it [[lake]], [[river]] or even a [[swamp]]. Or just hoard water - 100L drums last for very long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Tips for scavenging==&lt;br /&gt;
*Scavenging should not be the considered the same as truly clearing the city, scavenging should first be done either in the wilderness or the edges of the city first, and even there, scavenging should be done stealthily to avoid losing your spoils or your life.&lt;br /&gt;
*Travel light, only carry what you truly need to defend yourself and save space for loot, and to lower your encumbrance.&lt;br /&gt;
*[[Night Raids: Guide|Night raiding]] is very useful for going deeper into the city earlier in order to get to a certain building you really want to scavenge, see that guide on how to make the use of this strategy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Scavenging for food and drink==&lt;br /&gt;
Now you've settled in, you are ready for some food to cook, in earlier seasons, you are best off gathering and eating fresh fruits and vegetables, any canned food you find is best saved for [[winter]], when no fresh fruits and vegetables can be found. A good strategy is to eat what is going to expire first, and save longer lasting foods for later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Foraging in [[underbrush]]es in [[forest]]s will give you [[wild vegetables]], though these don't provide much calories, they are a valuable source of a little bit of nutrition and survival skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Come [[summer]] you are able to gather fruits in forests, and sometimes in towns. Plums, apricots, berries and various other foods all become available once the weather warms. These are surprisingly calorie dense, consider preserving some for the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Places to gather canned foods, alcohol, and ingredients for more complex food recipes include [[house]]s [[restaurant]]s, [[grocery store]]s, [[coffee shop]]s, [[pizza parlour]]s, and [[fast food restaurant]]s. Grocery stores should be raided before too many days pass, as they provide fruits and vegetables that will quickly rot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't be afraid to eat on the go! It doesn't take long for you to scarf down what you find. You can save some space in your pack by using the space in your stomach! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Scavenging for medicine==&lt;br /&gt;
Next on the survival priorities is medicine, you can find medicine in [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]], [[doctor's office]]s, bathrooms in houses, and sometimes basements and [[hospital]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Houses are the simplest places to start gathering medicine, simply look in the bathroom, do check the sink and toilets, because they may hide the medicine inside if you don't go right next to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pharmacies are simple enough, the door is usually unlocked, but sometimes you may need to either enter the counter via the back entrance or the door next to the counter, this can trigger the alarm, so watch out for the [[eyebot]]s that are summoned or any zombies that are investigating the noise. Basic medicines such as [[Aspirin]] can be found in the aisles out front, while stronger medicines and antibiotics can be found behind the counter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some pharmacies may not have a shutter on the counter, while these pharmacies are easier, there may be less meds found on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Scavenging for guns and ammo==&lt;br /&gt;
This is where your scavenging task will have a significant jump in difficulty. Guns and ammo are difficult to obtain in the early game, and most buildings that are liable to contain them are typically deeper in the city, where the larger hordes await you. However, firearms are essential for fighting off the ever evolving zombie hordes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Gun store]]s are the most obvious place to visit, but you will need a lockpick to enter their pesky metal doors. Otherwise, try a hacksaw to saw off the metal bars on the windows. Beware the eyebots that will come flying in when the alarm goes off, as well as zombies attracted to the noise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rarely, guns and ammo can be found on standard zombie corpses and in bedroom end tables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Certain zombies, such as zombie cops or zombie soldiers, can carry firearms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some houses can also contain a wealth of firearms and ammo in their basements, but beware: these basements may contain deadlier types of zombies than usual. [[Smoker zombie]]s and [[survivor zombie]]s are commonly found in these basements, so bring a gas mask and some good armor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some vehicles, such as police cars, armored cars, SWAT vans, and security vans, can also contain firearms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on your strength, you may need to prioritise certain firearms over others; if you are low strength, you may want to grab [[handguns]], if you are higher strength, you may want to grab heavier weapons like shotguns and rifles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of {{InlineVer|0.F}}, rifles cannot be stored in most backpacks, so you may want to bring some [[shoulder strap]]s to carry any rifles back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you don't predominantly use them due to strength issues, you may still want to obtain bigger guns for either if you do manage to increase your strength and carry capacity, or for any NPCs you recruit.&lt;br /&gt;

Luckily they are don't have good vision, but if they do end up noticing you then they will become aggressive and start swarming and drenching you in their acid.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

*Can be quite good to train one's [[unarmed]] skill due to their slow attack, just stomp on it when there are no zombies around to train the skill, their slowness makes them very easy to kill with no weapons even with 0 unarmed skill.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

== Notes ==&lt;br /&gt;
*If you manage to find this and some batteries for it, you have hit quite a milestone and jackpot, as this item allows you to [[Night Raids: Guide|sneak into cities at night]] without [[zombies]] easily noticing; going into the city during the daytime is basically inviting zombies to dinner unless you have the means to [[clearing the city|clear them out of the city]], and most [[firearms]] are more likely to be found in the city anyway...&lt;br /&gt;
*This may be surprising, but taking these goggles into the sewers and subway tracks is actually more dangerous than bringing a flashlight, as many of the monsters that dwell down in these areas; [[sewer rat]]s, [[seweranha]]s, and [[sewer snake]]s have night vision, but can't see well when the player brings a flashlight near them.&lt;br /&gt;
*Just remember, this item is useful for sneaking and stealthy attacks; fighting against a horde head-on with these valuable goggles on will lead to them breaking as they are fragile, do you really want to lose them in the middle of a zombie infested city?&lt;br /&gt;

Also, using a light in the [[sewer]]s and [[subway]]s can cause creatures such as [[sewer rat]]s, [[sewer snake]]s and [[seweranha]]s to become short sighted, as they have night vision, but no vision in the light, so it may be worth it to bring a flashlight down these areas even if the player has night vision equipment and abilities.&lt;br /&gt;

==Notes==&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!-- *YOUR PERSONAL NOTES AND HINTS GO BELOW HERE* --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*There are many exits within the [[hospital]], the main entrance however is likely to be surrounded by [[zombies]], so a player may want to avoid exiting via that way; instead the player may want to opt for exiting via the fire exits, where there may be no zombies at all upon exiting. Just try and keep quiet as possible as you move throughout the hospital, and never let the zombies corner you into any rooms, as it is a swift death with lack of equipment and the [[Frail]] trait.&lt;br /&gt;
*If you do escape the hospital, you are not out of the fire yet, as you are still in the city, you may want to either wait until night in a safe place to sneak out of the city, or survive in the city itself if you are lucky enough to find a good building for shelter and inconspicuousness.&lt;br /&gt;
*Another problem; you always start the scenario with the Frail trait, luckily however, you can mutate with the correct mutation trees to override this trait with the [[Resilient]] trait, the [[Medical]] mutation tree is best for this as it is low risk, medium to high award.&lt;br /&gt;

 |description=A translucent hexagonal chunk of wax, filled with dense, milky, bitter and acidic-tasting jelly. Though some hold it as a panacea, it doesn't have any medical benefit. Still it is rich with the most beneficial substances the hive can produce.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Notes ==&lt;br /&gt;
This substance is baby bee food created in the head of a nurse bee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All larva bees are fed royal jelly for three days and the diet then changes according to what the workers decide the bee should be. (Royal jelly for queens, a 1-1 mix of pollen and honey for workers, and a 3 pollen 1 honey mix for drones.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This item used to be a cure-all for many diseases, but as of [[0.E (Ellison)]], that use was removed from this item and replaced with a rare drug called [[Panaceus]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While royal jelly is now pretty useless by itself now, it can still be used to cook a very healthy and filling recipe called [[royal beef]], which increases the player's [[health]] stat by 10.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;* While relatively basic and weak, being common, they are the most common vector of [[infection]]s. Fighting zombies too much early in the game without any infection treatment puts the player at risk, as one bite can end up being fatal. Avoiding zombies as long as possible until an infection treatment is procured is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;
* Turns into a [[Tough zombie]] if it's near a [[Zombie master]].&lt;br /&gt;
* In the [[Dark Skies Above]] mod, these zombies are replaced by the [[Stray]], which is quite similar in behaviour, though is a little weaker HP wise and faster in movement than it's vanilla counterpart.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

While the smoke protection of this item is minuscule, and utterly useless against [[toxic gas]] and [[fungal haze]], wearing a dust mask decreases the chance of catching a [[low immunity diseases|cold or flu]], therefore one may want to wear this item whenever they can. &lt;br /&gt;

== Notes ==&lt;br /&gt;
*While this may have one of the highest storage capacities of any backpack, this bag is VERY encumbering, don't try fighting zombies too often while wearing this...&lt;br /&gt;
*Best used for non-combative [[scavenging]] trips, or when moving to a new base if you don't have a vehicle yet.&lt;br /&gt;
*Can be crafted quite early in the tailoring skill compared to other storage clothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

* {{InlineVer|0.8}} - Added.&lt;br /&gt;

== Notes ==&lt;br /&gt;
The form of storage with the highest capacity, except for the [[power armor hauling frame]] and [[duffel bag]], it's quite balanced for both combat and scavenging  as it isn't so encumbering compared to the duffel bag.&lt;br /&gt;
