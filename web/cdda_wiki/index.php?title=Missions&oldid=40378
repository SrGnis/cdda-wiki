You might have what it takes, or you might not.  Either way, I'm going to need some proof.  Come back in a few days and I'll gladly follow you.

Have you ever seen one of those science labs that have popped up in the middle of nowhere?  Them suckers have a glowing terminal out front so I know they have power somewhere inside'em.  If you can get inside and find a computer lab that still works you ought to be able to find out what's in the black box.

Check this out, it was on its approach to pick up a team sent to secure and destroy something called a 'Hazardous Waste Sarcophagus' in the middle of nowhere.  If the bird never picked up the team then we may still have a chance to meet up with them.  It includes an access code for the elevator and an encoded message for the team leader, I guess.  If we want to join up with what remains of the government then now may be our only chance.

We do have a new lead though, the ledger has a safe deposit box under the regional manager's name.  Guess what, dumb sucker wrote down his combination.

</th>
<td>St. Michael the archangel defend me in battle…
</td>
<td>From what I understand, the creatures you encountered surrounding this relic were unlike anything I've heard of.  It is laughable that I now consider the living dead to be part of our ordinary reality.  Never-the-less, the church must have some explanation for these events.  I have located the residence of a local clergy man, could you go to this address and recover any items that may reveal what the church's stance is on these events?

</td>
<td>I have another task if you are feeling up to it.  There is a prisoner that the priest made special mention of.  I was wondering if you could see what may have happened to him or if he left anything in his cell.  The priest admits the individual is rather unstable, to put it lightly, but the priest personally believed the man was some kind of repentant visionary.  I'm not in a position to cast out the account just yet… it seems the man has prophesied events accurately before concerning the Church of Starry Wisdom.

The towns have enough supplies for us survivors to start securing a foothold but we don't have anyone with the skills and equipment to thin the masses of undead.  I'll lend you a hand to the best of my ability but you really showed promise taking out that other beast.  You, I, and a 100 zombies laid to rest, what do you say?

The short of it is, kill the son of a bitch.  We don't know what it is capable of or why it is surrounded by other zombies but this thing reeks of trouble.

He's vain as hell but has a little skill with firearms.  He was supposed to collect whatever he had of value and is going to meet us at a cabin in the woods.  Wasn't sure how long we were going to be so I told him to just camp there until we picked him up.
