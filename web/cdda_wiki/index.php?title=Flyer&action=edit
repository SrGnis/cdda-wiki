This is a poster advertising a brand of a hybrid gas-electric vehicle. Poster claims that hybrid car is the "best of two worlds" with the acceleration capabilities of a sport car and fuel consumption of a compact car. Something called the "Smart Controller®" is mentioned several times, which, if you are to believe the poster, it is some kind of military technology adapted for civilian market and it works like magic. In the bottom there is a slogan: "Enjoy your optimal ride with the Smart Engine Controller!" (338 fliers.json)
