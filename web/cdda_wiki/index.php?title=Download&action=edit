Most people play the experimental versions as they run pretty stable and contain a lot of improvements in comparison to the stable versions. If you prefer stability of everything else, then the stable versions are for you. With the experimentals there is always a slight risk of a gamebreaking bug, or a new feature which just isn't working as well as it should, but most people still play the more recent experimentals because they contain more content. You can always ask for a the latest experimental release people are currently using on [https://discord.gg/jFEc7Yp the C:DDA discord server].

== Link to the most recent stable build ==
[https://cataclysmdda.org/releases/#:~:text=0.F%2D3%20Download%20Links 0.F-3 Frank-3 Download]

== [[Experimental]] Builds ==

These versions are built each time a push is merged with the GitHub repository. They are the latest development builds available and are in no way guaranteed to be stable, or to support your current save game / world (Though many times they are just as stable as the "Stable" versions, if not moreso, and there is some effort to keep saves compatible). '''Use at your own risk.'''

== Self compile == 
You can also get the source code from [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA github] and then [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/COMPILING.md compile] it yourself. [[How_to_compile]] contains some outdated information on how to compile, which might help.

Various editions of the source code are tagged on github, for example this leads to [https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/releases/tag/0.7 the 0.7 source code], with some url manipulation you should be able to find other releases.

== Changing the font (SDL only) ==
This will only work with trueType fonts.

You have two options:
# Replace the default one, found in ''data\font'', with the one of your choice (simply delete the existing ''fixedsys.ttf'' one and copy on that folder the one you want to use).
# Edit the path of the FONTDATA file this way:
 c:\windows\fonts\&lt; name of your font >
 &lt; font width >
 &lt; font height >
 &lt; font size >
Example:
 c:\windows\fonts\lucon.ttf
