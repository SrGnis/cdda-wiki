</p><p>Some DARPA researchers successfully open unstable portals to nearby subdimensions, but never for very long.

<p><b>2005</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>April 2005</b> Advances in reverse engineering and some tests of portal tech lead to improved synthesis of fuel cells from the dimensional craft. These cells are still bulky but enable a lot of new technologies to be imagined. They use radioactive plutonium as a catalyst in the fuel reaction, earning the nickname “plutonium fuel cells”. Due to the risk of radioactivity, they are not widely adopted outside of experimental use.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sept</b> A stable portal is opened, and a creature from the netherum breaks through, destroying a large portion of a DARPA lab. The facility auto-destruct is engaged and the event disguised as a mine collapse. DARPA’s ability to continue portal research is hampered by red tape. Those depending financially on portals begin working harder on their shell companies, setting up secret research labs to continue working on portal tech outside DARPA’s interference.</li></ul>

</p><p>Research into pilotable robot exoskeletons results in the first large production robotic suit for cargo handling. It remains prohibitively expensive for most applications. These suits use a simplified fuel cell design from the dimensional craft, but not all the raw materials needed have yet been synthesized, so the efficiency is much lower.

</p><p><b>January 2015:</b> Artificial intelligence using dimensional probability heuristics is developed. This is an AI that can simulate deductive reasoning by scanning several adjacent realities to create a realistic estimation of the outcome of an action, quite analogous to human deductive reasoning. On a small scale, this is surprisingly efficient.

It is a useful research assistant using dimensional heuristics but nowhere near as intelligent as hoped, due to the prohibitive power requirements of anticipating more than a few minutes ahead in time. Its inability to plan in the long term is seen as a crippling defect, but it remains an overall success.</li>
<li><b>June 2017</b>: The first powered exoskeletons are approved for military use, in limited test deployments. Although incredibly powerful against small arms fire, these “tank suits” are too large, expensive, and heavy to gain any advantages from their humanoid shape. They do not see full scale production.</li></ul>

<li><b>January</b>: US reopens portal research, considering it a safer proposition with CBM enhanced soldiers and Melchior’s assistance, and potentially a good way to get ahead of China.</li>
<li><b>July</b>: Researchers publish results regarding portal stability that help to explain the unexpectedly large portal of 9 years ago. Polydimensional topography has numerous stable planes, and the energy required to make portals to certain areas is much lower. Early researchers hadn’t known about this, and put far too much energy into a portal to an energetically accessible location, creating a much bigger portal than intended. This knowledge allows much safer exploration of micro portals.</li>
<li><b>November</b>: a research remote probe sent to an adjacent dimension brings back an unidentified biocontaminant, which is captured for analysis but inadvertently destroyed by standard safety procedures. <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">The Blob</a> becomes aware of our existence.</li></ul>

<p><b>2023</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>February 2023</b>: Immediately following Chinese New Year, a new wave of XFS empowered soldier is announced publicly. These represent the tip of the iceberg, and are considered dangerously competitive to NATO equivalents. Allied intelligence indicates that classified models may be far in advance of CBM-powered soldiers.</li>
<li><b>May</b>: <a href="./XEDRA.html" title="XEDRA">XEDRA</a> (Xenophysical Energy Defense Research Agency) is formed to focus research into transdimensional phenomena.  Publicly they are masked as DARPA researchers, and other more mundane groups. They are given an enormous budget, considered by the US government to be equivalent to NASA in the current cold war. Certain close allies to the US join the effort, sending top minds and resources to XEDRA facilities across North America.</li>
<li><b>August</b>: A XEDRA facility in the Northwest reports a major sample stolen. Counterintelligence identifies China as the most likely culprit, and backtraces the theft to hypothesize that significant XEDRA research data was compromised. New protocols are put in place to counter XFS equipped intelligence agents, including advanced robotic security managed by Melchior.</li>
<li><b>September</b>: XEDRA is broken into several connected but distinct agencies. In several of these agencies, desperate to catch up for time now lost by presumed stolen research, reasonable safety protocols are dropped in favour of Melchior predictions of immediate repercussions. This has the obvious (especially in hindsight) flaw that anything that does not have immediate repercussions will be missed: there are few lab explosions, but <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">the Blob</a> is able to leverage this weakness.</li>
<li><b>November 3</b>: The first manned research expedition to another dimension - rather, a between-space nicknamed “the netherum” by sci-fi obsessed researchers - is launched. Based on reports of strange, hard-to-comprehend geometry, researchers begin using terms from the works of classic horror writers to describe creatures found there.</li>
<li><b>December 18</b>: Sample <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">XE-037</a> is brought back to Earth from the netherum. It is about thirty grams of blob matter. Standard decontamination protocols are observed. However, standard protocols do not take into account the possibility of malicious, intelligent molecular-scale contaminants. Microscopic particles of <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">XE-037</a> migrate from the contamination filters onto the skin of scientists and escape containment. Soon after, <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">the Blob</a> enters the groundwater and begins to spread at extremely low concentrations.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li><b>January 2025</b>: <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">The blob</a> reaches satisfactory global-level groundwater saturation and makes the decision to commence the concentration and replication phase. For the next few weeks there is a gradual rise in violent crime, and occasional reports of strange mutations and weird animal sightings in the wild, but little attention is paid.</li>
<li><b>February 2025</b>: First reports of people rising from the dead, <a href="./XEDRA.html" title="XEDRA">XEDRA</a> immediately makes correct assumptions about what’s up as they’ve been experimenting on the blob and recognize its effects. The US government assumes it’s a controllable outbreak and tries to squelch reports to avoid classified information getting out. A very successful counterintelligence campaign makes YouTube reports of zombies and ferals into a high-quality prank that has caught on among the meme community. After all, any time a video comes out, an undoctored version surfaces not long after.</li>
<li><b>March 2025</b>: Nations that are already unstable start to see riots, as passive blob infection causes people to become more violent - some outright feral. A few small wars break out. Thanks to word spreading via the internet, people around the world generally realize something is amiss, but the US government and other allied international intelligence agencies continue to work hard on squashing it. At first it’s not hard, because the places it’s happening are places where the tipping point was reached sooner.</li>
<li><b>March 30 2025</b>: A soon-to-be famous YouTube video surfaces, of a screaming young mother violently killing what appears to be her own child amidst a riot in Minneapolis. For most survivors, this will be where they remember it becoming clear that things were really seriously wrong.</li>
<li><b>April 1 2025</b>: Attempts to keep it under wraps become unsustainable as violent outbursts become common in developed nations. Government changes the spin to “chinese mind control agents”. Upper ranking members of government also experience psychosis leading to some truly weird shit, like <a href="./Rhode_Island_secession.html" title="Rhode Island secession">Rhode Island declaring secession</a> from the US and war on the government.</li>
<li><b>April 10 2025</b>: A national state of emergency in the US is finally declared as the government realizes control is impossible. At this point riots are widespread and police are unable to keep it under control. Military is deployed, blob psychosis means their response is irrationally violent and they do not follow correct protocol. On top of that, those less affected are simply overwhelmed by live rioters and now hordes of undead mixed in.</li>
<li class="mw-empty-elt"></li>
<li><b>April 15 2025</b>: Just as government resources are strained to their absolute break point (globally, not just in the US), the <a href="./Portal_storms.html" title="Portal storms">portal storms</a> begin. <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">The blob</a> exercises a shred of effort for the first time since it entered our dimension, and bends reality so that the access energy to create dimensional rifts is far easier. Gates to the netherum open spontaneously, allowing rampaging beasts of indescribable form to add their involvement to the already rampant chaos. Amidst the violence, <a href="./Lore#XE037.html" title="Lore">the blob</a> sends in a collection of <a href="./The_Blob%27s_Lieutenants.html" title="The Blob's Lieutenants">its Lieutenants</a>, alien zombies that have been evolving and growing for centuries or millennia. They begin organizing the burgeoning zombie hordes in tactically important locations.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>April 16 2025</b>: In response to <a href="./Portal_storms.html" title="Portal storms">portal storms</a>, the government nukes as many lab facilities as it can, pinning the attacks on China. With much of the command chain mentally influenced by the blob, military and police responses to the rioting, zombie hordes, and now extradimensional monsters and alien zombie armies are worse than suboptimal and in most cases actively harmful. Similar responses are seen in other countries. Things spiral out of control quickly now, with each passing day seeing rapidly mounting casualties as the people still in their right minds are largely killed off and turned to zombies.</li>
<li><b>April 25 2025</b>: (Canonical date of Cataclysm) A low-ranking US government official manages to get access to the emergency broadcast system, and sends out a final message. “The government has fallen. No help is coming, you’re on your own.”</li>
