!Find Corporate Accounts
|NPC (Corporate) 1
|Those twisted snakes…
|Our world fell apart because our leaders were as crooked as the con-men that paid for their elections. Just find me one of those corporate accounting books and I'll show you and the rest of the world just who is at fault.
|Go to the marked location and find a corporate accounting book; return with it to the NPC.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Retrieve Deposit Box
|NPC (Corporate) 2
|Now I don't mean to upset you but I'm not sure what I can do with the accounting ledger at the moment. We do have a new lead though, the ledger has a safe deposit box under the regional manager's name. Guess what, dumb sucker wrote down his combination. Come with me to retrieve the box and you can keep any of the goodies in it that I can't use to press charges against these bastards.
|
|Find the safety deposit box and return it to the NPC.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Find Deputy Badge
|NPC (Corporate) 3
|I hope you will find use from what you got out of the deposit box but I also have another job for you that might lead you to an opportunity to deal out justice for those who cannot. First things first, we can't just look like ruffians. Find us a deputy badge, easy enough?
|
|Find a deputy's badge. They can be found at police stations.
|Relationship; trade, training.
|-
!Find Patient Records
|NPC (Medical) 1
|I've lost so many friends… please find me a patient list from the regional hospital or doctor's office.  I just want to know who might still be out there.
|Go to the hospital marked on your map and bring back the patient records. Hospitals are dangerous locations; be careful.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Reach FEMA Camp
|NPC (Medical) 2
|Maybe they escaped to one of the camps…
|I can't thank you enough for bringing me the patient records but I do have another request.  You seem to know your way around… could you take me to one of the FEMA camps?  I know some were overrun but I don't want to believe all of them could have fallen.
|Go to the FEMA camp marked on your map.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Reach Farm House
|NPC (Medical) 3
|I just need a place to start over…
|'ve accepted that everyone I used to know is dead… one way or another.  I really wish I could have done something to save my brother but he was one of the first to go.  I'd like to start over, just rebuild at one of the farms in the countryside.  Can you help me secure one?"
|Go to the farmhouse marked on your map.
|Relationship; trade, training. NPC may leave your party to stay at the farmhouse.
|-
!Find Flag
|NPC (Patriot) 1
|Does our flag still yet wave? We're battered but not yet out of the fight, we need the old colors!
|Does our flag still yet wave? We're battered but not yet out of the fight, we need the old colors!
|Find an American Flag and bring it back to the NPC.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Retrieve Military Black Box
|NPC (Patriot) 2
|We've got the flag, now we need to locate US forces.
|We have the flag but now we need to locate US troops to see what we can do to help. I haven't seen any but I'm figurin' one of those choppers that were flyin' round during th' outbreak would have a good idea. If you can get me a black box from one of the wrecks I'll look into where we might open 'er at.
|Return to the NPC with a Black Box.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Retrieve Black Box Transcript
|NPC (Patriot) 3
|With the black box in hand, we need to find a lab.
|Thanks to your searching we've got the black box but now we need to have a look inside her. Now, most buildings don't have power anymore but there are a few that might be of use. Have you ever seen one of those science labs that have popped up in the middle of nowhere? Them suckers have a glowing terminal out front so I know they have power somewhere inside 'em. If you can get inside and find a computer lab that still works you ought to be able to find out what's in the black box.
|Explore a lab, use a terminal to read the black box and print out a transcript; return to the NPC with it.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Follow Sarcophagus Team
|NPC (Patriot) 4
|Holy hell, the crash you recovered the black box from wasn't as old as I thought. Check this out, it was on its approach to pick up a team sent to secure and destroy something called a 'Hazardous Waste Sarcophagus' in the middle of nowhere. If the bird never picked up the team then we may still have a chance to meet up with them. It includes an access code for the elevator and an encoded message for the team leader, I guess. If we want to join up with what remains of the government then now may be our only chance.
|
|Go to the location marked on your map. The NPC will join your team.
|Relationship; trade, training.
|-
!Find Relic
|NPC (Religious) 1
|As the world seems to abandon the reality that we once knew, it becomes plausible that the old superstitions that were cast aside may have had some truth to them. Please go and find me a religious relic… I doubt it will be of much use but I've got to hope in something.
|
|Go to the marked location and bring back the Small Relic found there.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Recover Priest's Diary
|NPC (Religious) 2
|From what I understand, the creatures you encountered surrounding this relic were unlike anything I've heard of. It is laughable that I now consider the living dead to be part of our ordinary reality. Never-the-less, the church must have some explanation for these events. I have located the residence of a local clergy man, could you go to this address and recover any items that may reveal what the church's stance is on these events?
|
|Go to the house marked on your map and return with the priest's diary.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Investigate Cult
|NPC (Religious) 3
|You have no idea how interesting this diary is. I have two very promising leads… first things first, the Catholic Church has been performing its own investigations into global cult phenomenon and it appears to have become very interested in a local cult as of recently. Could you investigate a location for me? I'm not sure what was going on here but the priest seemed fairly worried about it.
|
|Go to the location marked on your map and return with an etched skull.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Prison Visionary
|NPC (Religious) 4
|I have another task if you are feeling up to it. There is a prisoner that the priest made special mention of. I was wondering if you could see what may have happened to him or if he left anything in his cell. The priest admits the individual is rather unstable, to put it lightly, but the priest personally believed the man was some kind of repentant visionary. I'm not in a position to cast out the account just yet… it seems the man has prophesied events accurately before concerning the Church of Starry Wisdom.
|
|Go to the location marked on your map and return with the book "Visions in Solitude".
|Relationship; trade, training.
|-

!Kill Jabberwock
|NPC (Zombie Hunter) 1
|A few days ago another survivor and I were trying to avoid the cities by staying in the woods during the day and foraging for gear at night. It worked well against the normal zed's but one night something caught onto our trail and chased us for ten minutes or so until we decided to split up and meet-up back here. My buddy never showed up and I don't have the means to kill whatever it was. Can you lend a hand?
|
|Go to the marked location and kill the Jabberwock.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Kill 100 Zombies
|NPC (Zombie Hunter) 2
|You're kitted out better than most… would you be interested in making this world a little better for the rest of us? The towns have enough supplies for us survivors to start securing a foothold but we don't have anyone with the skills and equipment to thin the masses of undead. I'll lend you a hand to the best of my ability but you really showed promise taking out that other beast. You, I, and a 100 zombies laid to rest, what do you say?
|
|Kill 100 regular zombies.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Kill Horde Master
|NPC (Zombie Hunter) 3
|Apparently one of the other survivors picked up on an unusually dense horde of undead moving into the area. At the center of this throng there was a 'leader' of some sort. The short of it is, kill the son of a bitch. We don't know what it is capable of or why it is surrounded by other zombies but this thing reeks of trouble. Do whatever it takes but we can't risk it getting away.
|
|Go to the marked location and kill the Horde Master.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Recruit Tracker
|NPC (Zombie Hunter) 4
|We've got another problem to deal with but I don't think we can handle it on our own. So, I sent word out and found us a volunteer… of sorts. He's vain as hell but has a little skill with firearms. He was supposed to collect whatever he had of value and is going to meet us at a cabin in the woods. Wasn't sure how long we were going to be so I told him to just camp there until we picked him up.
|
|Go to the marked location and talk to the NPC there.
|Relationship; trade, training; follow-up mission available.
|-
!Find Deputy Badge
|NPC (Zombie Hunter) 5 Tracker
|I got the brief so I know what I'm getting into. Let me be upfront, treat me like shit and I'm going to cover my own hide. However, you treat me well and give me something to believe in, even if it's just a shiny bit of metal, and I'll do you right. Without a strong band a man doesn't stand a chance in this world. You ready to take charge boss? This world could use a Sheriff just about now.
|
|Bring a deputy badge to the Tracker.
|Relationship; trade, training. The Tracker will join your party.
|-
!Analyze Zombie Blood
|NPC
|I need someone to get a sample of zombie blood, take it to a hospital, and perform a centrifuge analysis of it.
|
|
|
|-
!Angry pyromaniac
|NPC
|I'm so **** infuriated! I've got an enemy that ruined my life, and now I want to get revenge! I don't care about the Cataclysm, I just want to burn his house! Would you help me, [Player Name]?
|

|NPC
|I left my poor dog in a house, not far from here. Can you retrieve it?

|Relationship; trade or training.
|-
!Find Weather Log
|NPC
|Everyone who dies gets back up, right? Which means that whatever is causing this it must be airborne to have infected everyone. I believe that if that is the case then there should be regions that were not downwind from where-ever the disease was released. We need to find a record of all the weather patterns leading up to the outbreak.
|
|Go to the radio station marked on your map and return with the weather log found there.
|Relationship; trade or training. 
|-
!Gather cattail stalks to create cattail jelly
|NPC
|Gather 80 cattail stalks from the swamp and bring them back to learn how to craft cattail jelly. Raise your survival skill to at least 1 by harvesting cattail stalks. Bring back the provided bag as well.
|Medical services are a little sparse following the Cataclysm, but people have been surviving using their wits and the bounty of Mother Nature for a long time. Care to learn a little?
|Be holding 80 cattail stalks and the duffel bag the survivor gave you and have a Survival skill of 1 or higher.
|Learn cattail jelly recipe.

!Kill Zombie Mom
|NPC
|My mom… she's… she was killed, but then she just got back up… she's one of those things now. Can you put her out of her misery for me?
|
|Go to the location on the map and kill the named zombie.
|Relationship; trade or training. Spiritual NPCs will get a mood boost for building a coffin and burying the named zombie.
|-
!Prove your worth to Foodperson
|NPC
|Show me the proof of your loyalty to the great Foodplace, and I'll consider you worthy of my friendship. Ten loyalty cards should be enough, I'm sure you already have much more than that waiting for you at home, right?
|
|Find 10 Foodplace Loyalty Cards. They can often be found in wallets.
|Relationship; trade, training.
|-
!Prove You're A Survivor
|NPC
|Prove you're a survivor by surviving for 10 days after the Cataclysm, and then returning to the person who gave you this mission.
|It's hard surviving out here on our own, and we'd probably have a better chance working together.  Problem is, I don't really know you and what you're capable of.  You might have what it takes, or you might not.  Either way, I'm going to need some proof.  Come back in a few days and I'll gladly follow you.  It's basically a win-win for me: either you come back and I'll know you've got what it takes, or you don't and I'll know that I was right not to follow you.
|Survive for 10 days, then talk to the NPC.
|NPC will join you; trade or training.
|-
!Retrieve Software

!Follow the directions on the pictographic sign
|Examining the sign
|I found a weird pictographic sign that seemed to point towards someone willing to trade.
|This is a sign with a series of simple line-art pictograms showing what appears to be a basic trade transaction. A pair of hands offers a piece of some kind of junk, and another pair of hands offers a small pouch in return.

|I was out scavenging recently, and I found one of those old evac shelters. Turns out the computer was still on and it had an address for a refugee center. I think my skills might be useful to them, for helping maintain medical supplies and whatnot, so I want you to head over there and see if they're interested. I'd do it myself, but I need to look after this place.

As the only apparent health authority left, I do have to warn you not to get it on your skin, though. Find this for me and I'll sell you whatever I can make.

!Refurbishments
|
|Obtain 100 planks.
|My buddies and I have decided to stay here for a while. This is about the only safe place out here, and it's kinda become our home. Anyway, we're going to build a wall. Our old logs have provided a bunch of the wood, but we still need quite a few planks. About 100 of them. If you could get it for us, I'd be grateful.

|
|
|-
!Refurbishments Pt. VI
|
|Obtain a charcoal smoker.
|Turns out that ant meat you got us wasn't actually too bad. A little tough, sure, but perfectly edible. The problem now is we need a way of preserving it. One of those portable charcoal smokers would be really great. Heck, you might even wanna buy some.

! Reach Refugee Center

| n/a
| Go to the refugee center (highlighted on your map).
| n/a
|-
! Alonso must have his special pants
| Alonso Lautrec
| I think I might know where those special pants might be though… (Alonso got drunk, crashed a party, and lost his pants. He wants them back.)
| Bring Alonso one pair of leather pants. The location indicated on your map is an adult bookstore, but any pair of leather pants will do.
| Alonso will now offer you his escort services if you have a condom.
|-
! Find someone to clean up the back bay.
| Boris Borichenko Mission 1
| Boris in the refugee center is looking for at least five people to help clear up the back bay.
| Get five people to agree to help with the job. Guneet Singh, Aleesha Seward, Garry Villenueve, Uyen Tran, Rhyzaea Johnny, and the Old Guard Representative can be persuaded. The Teamster will agree without persuasion, and Smokes can be given either 5 or 10 Merch to hire the guards to help; 10 Merch will hire two guards and Smokes will also agree.
|5 Merch; relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Bring Boris a circular saw.
| Boris Borichenko Mission 2
| We now have a space to work in, and I have wood and nails to spare.  All I need is a saw.  I would love tablesaw and mitre saw, but I can work with a hand held circular saw for now.  I have looked, and what we have is garbage.  Can you bring me a good one?
|Talk to Boris with a Circular Saw in your inventory.
|5 Merch; relationship, trade, or training. Boris will now sell training in Carving, Basic Carpentry, and Plumbing.
|-
!Bring Boris his son's lost writing.
| Boris Borichenko Mission 3
| If you can find it, it would mean so much to me.  I will give you directions to the shelter where he left it.  It was barely a shelter, broken and torn apart.  It should just be on the floor where it was dropped.
| Go to the location marked and pick up Ash's Laptop Computer. Return it to Boris.
|5 Merch; relationship, trade, or training.
|-
!Find Dana's family sourdough culture
| Dana Nunez, after buying some of her sourdough bread, or trading her flour for bread.
| If you really like this second-rate bread, you could risk your life for something actually worth it.  I left my actual sourdough starter back in the bakery where I worked.  That baby is a hundred years old, and has been in my family for generations. If you can bring him to me, I'll bake you the finest bread you've ever had.
|Go to location highlighted on the map, a bakery, and bring back Dana's family sourdough starter.
|After a 14-day wait, Dana will start to sell high-quality sourdough bread.
|-
! Bring 40 small cardboard boxes
| Dino Dave, Mission 1
| Gotta start small right?  Little ones for keeping little things safe.  I could use 'em.  I need a bunch of 'em.  Little ones, you know?  Can you bring me like… like… forty?
| Bring Dave 40 of the item "small cardboard box".
| Unlocks mission "Bring a roll of duct tape".
|-
! Bring a roll of duct tape
| Dino Dave, Mission 2
| These ones are good, good ones.  They need something to, you know, bind them together.  Surround them, light side, dark side.  Bring me the Force!
| Bring Dave 200 units of Duct Tape.
| Unlocks mission "Bring 10 Cardboard Boxes".
|-
! Bring 10 cardboard boxes
| Dino Dave, Mission 3
| Ten bigger ones now please.  The list doesn't lie.  You've done so well.  I got a little more on the list, but we're more than half there.
| Bring Dave 10 of the item "Cardboard Box".
| Unlocks mission "Bring 10 large plastic sheets".
|-
! Bring 10 large plastic sheets
| Dino Dave, Mission 4
| If I can set it up in here I won't need it, but they might drive me out, so I guess I need some plastic just in case.  I don't like it, the sandman can smell through plastic, but I think the cardboard is stronger.
| Bring Dave 10 of the item "Large Plastic Sheet". They can be found, among other places, by deconstructing the ground sheets at mass graves.
| Unlocks mission "Bring 5 large cardboard boxes"
|-
! Bring 5 large cardboard boxes
| Dino Dave, Mission 5
| This is the last thing I need from you.  I've been collecting the other parts myself, it's been easier with more cardboard around.  Can you bring me five more really big cardboard boxes?
| Bring Dave 5 "Large Cardboard Box". These can be taken down where found and folded and unfolded via crafting to make them easier to haul; unfolding them takes duct tape to glue them back together.
| Dino Dave builds his cardboard mansion; the other beggars see you as trustworthy.
|-
! Bring an acoustic guitar
| Draco Dune
| I just want a functional acoustic guitar.  Preferably one that hasn't been used to cave in any zombie skulls.
| Bring Draco an Acoustic Guitar.
| Relationship, trade, or training. Draco will pay 6 Merch instead of 4 for 5 marijuana or 5 joints, and will buy every few days.
|-
! Go check out this island
| Draco Dune (Mod: Xedra)
| This is where the island I agreed to a strange deal is.  I wonder if they're still there.
| Go to the location marked on your map.
| Relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Find a copy of the Quran
| Fatima al Jadir
| I could use a bit of help to find a copy of the Quran.
| The Quran is not guaranteed to spawn anywhere, but libraries and bookstores are most likely.
|5 Merch. Relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Find reference materials about air rifles for Jenny.
| Jenny Forcette
| If you happen to see anything in your travels about high-powered air rifles, it would help a lot.
| Jenny wants the book "Pneumatic Pnowledge" or its alternate titles. Try bookstores and libraries.
|4 Merch. Relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Find an electric motor
| Jenny Forcette, after giving her the book and waiting a while.
| Before I get anything going, I'm going to need to set up a compressor.  I have a lot of the stuff for that, but I need a large tank for air, and a good sized electric motor - about 10 kg or so.  I'm also going to need a 60 liter tank, after that.
|Bring Jenny an electric motor, you can find one in electric car or a hybrid car
|4 Merch. Relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Bring back a 60L metal tank
| Jenny Forcette, after giving her the motor and waiting a while.
| I can get started building the compressor, but I need a large metal tank to store compressed air centrally.  About 60 liters should do
|Bring back a 60L metal tank
|5 Merch. Relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Find a gunsmithing textbook
| Jenny Forcette, after giving her the tank
| I need a good quality reference book on gunsmithing.  This isn't my area of expertise, and I don't want to blow anybody up.
|Bring Jenny the book "Ballistics: Theory, Design, and Application" or one of its alternate titles.
|5 Merch. Relationship, trade, or training. The defense turrets Jenny mentions aren't available to the player, but raise refugee happiness.
|-
!Analyze Zombie Blood
|Refugee Center Doctor
|First, you need to kill any zombie and extract the blood from its body using the blood draw kit.\nSecond, you need to deliver this blood to any working centrifuge with a computer. Equipment like this can most commonly be found at hospitals, but you can also try to search for it at medical labs.\nThird, you need to place the extracted blood on the centrifuge and analyze it using the computer nearby. If you're successful, the data will be written on an empty USB drive you have to provide.\nFinally, you need to bring the USB drive with the data back to the Doctor.
|We don't have the equipment for real analysis here so it'll need to be done in the field. I need you to get a fresh sample of zombie blood, take it to a hospital, and perform a centrifuge analysis of it.
|software_blood_data
|
|-
!Download Encryption Codes
|Refugee Center Doctor
|
|Unfortunately the data you got was incomplete and mostly encrypted. There may be a way to get encryption codes, though. I found a complaint by the infosec team that they were unable to deliver critical security updates to one research site. It was some kind of more restricted secondary site hidden beneath a town, they weren't allowed in. That means it should have unsecured computers we can get the codes from.
|
|
|-
!Download Research Archives
|Refugee Center Doctor
|
|So there looks to be months, maybe years of experiments, and that data set must be huge. Database servers massive enough to house it would overheat running on emergency power. But I did find communications from a lab that had some kind of freezing portal open during the Cataclysm, sending everything to subzero temperatures. I bet the archives inside that lab are still working.",
|software_lab_data
|
|-
!Download Workstation Data
|Refugee Center Doctor
|
|The medical software didn't just analyze the blood, it triggered a government alert. Medical staff was under orders to immediately drive any matching samples to the nearest laboratory. That must mean the government knew! We have the destination address. Go there, get in, and bring back any records you can download off a computer.
|
|
|-
!Find Lab Tunnels
|Refugee Center Doctor
|
|In the data we found a major contract for tunneling and train equipment, ordered eight months ago. It's the best lead we have. Here's the address of the government lab where the equipment was delivered. I want you to go there, find the tunnels that they dug, and download everything you can about the train network.

|-
! Find 50 doses of antiseptic
| Uyen Tran Mission 1
| There's the doc out front helping anyone that can pay but for us up here, money mostly goes to food.  I could do a lot for basic cuts, bruises, and common stuff if I had some supplies to help out.  Could you bring me some antiseptic?  Six bottles would probably be enough to last us a while.
|Give Uyen 50 doses of antiseptic. It doesn't matter how many bottles it's in.
|7 Merch; relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Find 30 bandages
| Uyen Tran Mission 2
| There's the doc out front helping anyone that can pay but for us up here, money mostly goes to food.  I could do a lot for basic cuts, bruises, and common stuff if I had some supplies to help out.  Could you bring me a few extra bandages?  Thirty would probably be enough to last us a while.
| Give Uyen 30 bandages. 
| 7 Merch; relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Find 6 bottles of antidepressant
| Uyen Tran Mission 3
| I probably shouldn't be prescribing things, but there's a ton of people needing help with sleep in here.  If you could get us some antidepressants, Rhyzaea and I can probably make sure they're doled out appropriately without people having to starve to pay for them.  Three month's worth - about 6 bottles - would last us a little while.
| Bring Uyen 60 doses of antidepressant.
| 5 Merch; relationship, trade, or training.
|-
! Make a makeshift haircut kit for Vanessa Toby in the refugee center
| Vanessa Toby
| I didn't think to pack my hairdressing equipment when I was evacuated.  If you could put together a basic hair cutting kit for me, I could do a bit of styling for people around here.  I'll even give you a free haircut for your troubles.
|A Makeshift Haircut Kit can be made from thread, leather or fur, cotton, a pair of office scissors, and a hand mirror (can be obtained by removing side-view mirrors from cars). The recipe is available at Fabrication 1.
| Relationship, trade, or training. Vanessa will give you one free haircut and will start selling haircuts.
|-
! Smokes, Let's Go
| [Front room guard]
| Make a friend at the refugee center by handing over around five packs - 100 cigarettes.
| Talk to the guard while carrying 100 cigarettes.
| Improved relationship with the Old Guard Representative.
|-
!Kill Bandits
|Old Guard Representative Mission 1
|A pair of bandits have been preying on locals, based out of a nearby cabin.  Ensure they meet a bitter end along with any associates, but watch out for traps around their hideout.
| Go to the location indicated and kill all bandits there. There will be more than two, and they will have set traps.
| Improved relationship, tutoring, or trade. 
|-
!Deal with Informant
|Old Guard Representative Mission 2
|The Hell's Raiders bandit group may have an informant working inside the Refugee Center.  Investigate and bring them to justice without arousing any suspicions.
| Find the guard who looks suspicious. Ask him if he's been hiding something, then use intimidate or persuade to turn him hostile before killing him.
| Improved relationship, tutoring, or trade. 
|-
!Find Source of Robots
|Old Guard Representative Mission 3
|I don't usually hear much from command, but we got a message by radio recently.  You might be the right choice to look into it for me.  There've been reports of weird robots and things wandering around since things went south.  Dunno how, but apparently command tracked down what they think is the source.  They want someone to go check out who is making these, and if we can get any tech or assistance from them.  This is strictly recon, you understand: could be a hostile entity, so do not engage directly.
| Go to the location indicated on your map. Explore the structure you find and talk to the NPC there. Then go back to the Old Guard Representative and tell him about what you found. 
| Improved relationship, tutoring, or trade. 
|-
!Secure Trade Route
|Old Guard Representative Mission 4
|One of the Free Merchants silently disappeared while escorting a trade caravan.  Whoever or whatever is responsible must be quick and quiet - investigate the trade route and eliminate the threat.
|Go to the location indicated on your map. Kill the monster you find there.
| Improved relationship, tutoring, or trade. 
|-
!Assassinate Raider Leader
|Old Guard Representative Mission 5
|The Old Guard have located a Hell's Raiders encampment that is coordinating attacks on the Free Merchants.  Pay them a visit and execute the area leadership.
|Go to the location indicated on your map. Kill the numerous raiders you will find there.
| Improved relationship, tutoring, or trade; Marshal badge, six-shooter pistol, and US Marshal trait given when mission is assigned.
|-
!Unknown Recipient
|Smokes
|Deliver the FEMA hard drive to the strange group that Smokes mentioned.  Return to the evacuation center when the data's been delivered.
|Kill the special zombie in the back bay of the refugee center.
|Contact with Hub 01 and its missions

|Kill the special zombie in the back bay of the refugee center.
|25 Merch; relationship, training, or trade.
|-
!Missing Caravan
|Smokes Mission 2
|Investigate the last known location of a disappeared scavenger trading party, and eliminate any bandits or raiders in the vicinity in exchange for 30 certified notes.
|Go to the marked location and kill all raiders.
|25 Merch; relationship, training, or trade.
|-

| Smokes Mission 3
|Visit the farming commune and bring the foreman's prospectus back to the refugee center, for 50 certified notes.
|Go to the farming commune and talk to the foreman for the prospectus, then talk to Smokes.
|50 Merch; relationship, training, or trade.
|-
!Solar Power
|Smokes Mission 4
|Deliver 10 solar panels to help the Free Merchants set up a renewable power grid, in exchange for a handsome reward.
|Bring 10 Solar Panel to Smokes.
|100 Merch; relationship, training, or trade.
|-
!In a Pickle
|Smokes Mission 5
|Deliver 100 0.5L glass jars to the Free Merchants to kickstart their food storage plans.
|Bring 100 0.5L Glass Jar to Smokes.
|100 Merch; relationship, training, or trade; Broker will now buy glass jars.
|-
!Check out bullet bank

!Find 10 Sugar Beet Seeds
|Bartender
|
|Sugar and molasses remains in short supply. I've put in a request for more, but it is unlikely that I'm going to see a reliable source for some time. If you are interested, we are going to need sugar beet seeds to meet future demand regardless of what the scavengers can find. Could you bring me at least enough seeds to plant a small 10 meter long patch?
|
|
|-
!Find 12 60-Liter Metal Tanks
|Bartender
|
|The drinks we brew here have become a major draw for visitors and the occasional trader. Our batches have become larger, but we are still running out of storage space between trading runs. I've been able to get a few volunteers to help me build a set of standing tanks, but I still need 12 60-liter metal tanks to build them. I've talked with the scrappers, but we are a low priority at the moment.
|
|
|-
!Find 2 200-Liter Drums
|Bartender
|
|The other survivor outposts that we have contact with have been more than eager to trade for beer or other drinks. Transporting the drinks to them has presented a number of challenges though. If you could locate a pair of 200-liter drums, we should be able to keep them supplied while turning a significant profit.
|
|
|-
!Find 20 Yeast
|Bartender
|
|The last batch that I brewed was terrible, I'm fairly sure something contaminated the yeast we have been using. Could you locate a source of fresh yeast for us to use? I'd need about 20 teaspoons of dry yeast to get started.
|
|
|-
!Make 2 Stills
|Bartender
|
|The wine and beer we can brew are sufficient to attract most patrons, but we need something a bit stronger to get them to forget their misery. Could you build me a pair of stills?
|
|
|-
!A Crutch to Lean on
|Doctor
|Bring the doctor some crutches.
|One of the laborers injured their foot pretty badly and I don't want them walking on it for a few days at least. Do you think you could find a pair of crutches?
|
|
|-
!Anesthetic for the Doctor
|Doctor
|Bring the doctor 3000 units of anesthetic. Ask around the commune for assistance in building an anesthetic machine.",
|I want to make sure we are setup to handle any major surgeries that come our way, but pain management is going to be an issue. For longer surgeries, we're going to need some anesthetic. Can you bring me 3000 units to start? We're also going to need an anesthetic machine to deliver it. Maybe some people around the commune can help with that?
|
|
|-
!Find 5 Pairs of Medical Gloves
|Doctor
|Bring the doctor 5 pairs of medical gloves.
|We're getting a lot of scrapes and bruises coming in right now, but it's only a matter of time before we see a serious injury. I'm not prepared for when that happens and I'm hoping you can help. To start off, I'm going to need some more medical gloves to help prevent infections. Can you bring me 5 pairs?

!Collect 100 Aspirin
|Nurse
|
|I've got a handful of bandages and a few first aid kits to work with at the moment… in other words I'm completely unable to treat most serious medical emergencies. I'm supposed to have priority on any medical supplies that the scavengers bring in, but I imagine the black market for the stuff will prevent me from ever seeing it. I could use your help getting a few bottles of aspirin to start with.
|
|
|-
!Collect 200 Multivitamin Pills
|Nurse
|
|Disease is spreading rapidly due to poor nutrition and there is little that I can do about it. With food being scarce, people are willing to survive on whatever they can. I need to start supplementing the outpost's diet with vitamins to prevent potential deaths indirectly attributable to nutrition. I know it is a lot, but if you could bring me 200 multivitamin pills, I'd be able to treat the most vulnerable before they spread anything to the rest of us.
|
|
|-
!Collect 3 Hotplates
|Nurse
|
|I was given a few bottles of bleach when I arrived, but I need a number of hotplates to actually sterilize equipment. I'm sure you can find them in any old house or appliance store. Three should be enough for now.
|
|
|-
!Find 10 Filter Masks
|Nurse
|
|The number of airway infections that I've encountered in the past week has depleted my supply of masks. Could you find me 10 filter masks? I tend to only distribute them in severe cases, so I'll be sure to make them last.
|
|
|-
!Find 10 Syringes
|Nurse
|
|We are starting to isolate a few natural antibiotic serums, but we don't have the supplies to administer the cocktails. I need you to bring me 10 empty syringes to use. I'll take care of cleaning them to prevent transferring infections.
|
|
|-
!Find 2 Scalpels
|Nurse
|
|I heard that we may have a physician on his way here. The workers have already begun expanding the clinic, but I need you to locate a pair of scalpels to use in surgery when he arrives. I'm sure you should be able to find them in a hospital or craft shop.
|
|
|-
!Find 4 Pairs of Rubber Gloves
|Nurse
|
|The bodily fluids that I often have to clean up and the caustic chemicals I deal with have done a number on my current pair of gloves. Could you find me four pairs of heavy rubber gloves? That should be enough that I can task a few laborers with cleanup details in the event of an outbreak.
|
|
|-
!Find a Chemistry Set
|Nurse
|
|I've been working on producing some of our own medical supplies, but I'm going to need a chemistry set to get everything that I need in order. Is there any way you could go through one of the school chemistry labs and steal me a chemistry set?
|
|
|-
!Find Advanced Emergency Care
|Nurse
|
|Have you heard of a book called the 'Guide to Advanced Emergency Care?' I really need a copy. The doctor is requesting a lot of supplies that I'm not familiar with, but I believe I could make if I could get a copy of the book.
|
|
|-
!Make 4 Charcoal Purifiers
|Nurse
|
|Despite my recommendations, we continue to have travelers come in with illnesses that I've been able to trace back to contaminated drinking water. When boiling water isn't an option, they need some form of charcoal water filter that they can use. If you could build me four charcoal water filters, I'll distribute them to groups as they pass through.
|
|
|-
!Make 12 Molotov Cocktails
|Scavenger
|
|When outnumbered or forced to pull back, my scavengers have been taught to throw Molotov cocktails to keep monsters from chasing them. We go through one or two on every mission, so we can always use a few more. Would you be willing to make us a dozen? I'm willing to pay you what I can for your assistance.",
|
|
|-
!Make 12 Simple Knife Spears
|Scavenger
|
|I can usually use additional survival gear to kit out the new recruits. The most basic weapon that everyone gets is the simple knife spear… it provides a good mix of range, power, and ease of use when engaging the more common monsters. Could you make me a dozen of them? I may need more later, but that should help the first few teams.
|
|
|-
!Make 3 Leather Body Armor
|Scavenger
|
|Clothing that can withstand the wear and tear of climbing through windows and fighting back wild animals is in high demand. The best that we have been able to find is leather body armor, but it is difficult to make with our limited resources. Could you craft us three pairs of leather body armor? The life expectancy of my scavengers would drastically increase if you did.",

!At Dooms' Gate
|
|Find a mi-go scout tower and kill its residents.
|We've found more aliens in the area. My scouts have reported a scout tower for those weird multi limbed aliens showed up recently, and that they might have prisoners inside. I want you to go over there and kill every last **** you can find, and free those prisoners. I'm not looking to recruit anyone you free from there, just make sure they're alright. Come back to me when you're done.
|
|
|-
!Blood Gulch
|
|Eliminate a bandit gang in exchange for ? chits.
|As of late, we've had some of the Hells Raiders trying to encroach on us and the local area. We've picked up a radio broadcast for one of their caravans, so I want you to go over and kill every **** who's there. You'll get a payment from me, and you'll have claim to all the stuff they were carrying.
|
|
|-
!Emancipation
|
|We've tracked some bandits back to one of their camps, and our scouts have reported that slaves are being held there. I need you to destroy the camp and free those slaves, then bring them back here. We'll give them room and board, and hopefully they'll join us.

|
|Rescue a raiding party that got stuck in town.
|One of the raiding parties sent out a distress signal. They're stuck in town on the roof of a house and are surrounded, with only enough supplies for a few days. I need you to go over there, rescue them, and bring them back alive.
|
|
|-
!Establish A Trade Route
|
|Establish trade relations between the evangelicals and a refugee center, and bring back a writ of the agreement.
|One of our raiding parties was out the other day, and came across an old evac shelter. They managed to pull and address for one of the refugee centers off the computer, and I mapped it out. I figure they could make good trade partners, so I want you to go over there and work out a deal for me.

|-
!Exterminate 1000 Zombies
|
|Kill 1000 zombies for the Valhallists
|With the recent success we've had in killing the otherworldly threats, we must take grander strides in making the world safe again. I need you to go out and kill one thousand zombies to do your new part in this endeavor. A handsome reward will be provided upon your return.
|
|

!Kill 300 Zombies
|
|Kill 300 zombies for the Valhallists
|You've proven yourself as a competent warrior, and we need your services again. Scavenging runs have been delayed recently due to hordes of undead blocking off towns, and nearly killing one of us last time. I need you to help exterminate this threat, so go kill three hundred of those ****s for us.
|
|
|-
!Obtain 100 Mushroom Spores
|
|Bring me one hundred mushroom spores.
|The high gode is starting a project to replace biospheres ravaged by the Mycus, and to make some money on farming. Right now, I need to get one hundred mushroom spores for him, but I haven't the slightest idea where. If you could do it, I'd pay fairly for them.
|
|

!Obtain 100 steel welding rods

|

|-
!Obtain 25 liters of acetylene
|
|Bring me 25 liters of acetylene.
|With all the repairs we've been doing around here, my team is running low on welding gas. Without it, I can't fix any busted bikes or make any new ones, so I need you to get me twenty-five liters of acetylene. I'll pay you well for it.
|
|
|-
!Obtain 25 motorbike tires
|
|Bring me 25 car tires.
|There's been a few too many flats around here, and I'm low on working tires. If you bring me 25 of them, I'll pay fairly.
|

|-
!Obtain 3 Hazmat Suits
|
|Bring me three hazmat suits.
|Our warriors have been dealing with fungal infestations recently, but we don't have the equipment to properly deal with them. Their spores have been giving us trouble, so I want you to find three hazmat suits. With those, we could circumvent their biggest threat while we torch those mushrooms to the ground. I'll pay you liberally with whatever we have in stock.
|
|
|-
!Obtain 30 Glass Bottles
|
|Bring me thirty glass bottles
|Those hazmat suits really helped out with the fungus problem, but we're in need of incendiaries to burn up those fungal beds. If you could get me thirty glass bottles, I can provide the rest of what we need for the Molotovs. How's that sound for a days' work?
|
|
|-
!Pyromanic Dreams
|
|Exterminate a fungal blossom
|My scouts have reported activity of those mushrooms nearby. I want you to go over there and kill all the mushroom you see, then burn their colony to ash. I have some Molotovs ready for you to do that with.
|
|
|-
!Season Of The Stones
|
|Retrieve a spiral stone.
|I've been looking into some of those otherworldly things the scouts have documented. The other day, they went to an old mine, and found it filled with spiral patters. I want you to bring me one of the stones from that place, so that I may study it.

Billy did a really good job taking it out, but I want to leave this storage unit with you and if I'm going to do that I need a working heart. My first idea was to take yours, but you probably need it even more. You know who has a nice big juicy heart? Billy does. And I bet I know where Billy is.

|While we were out on a hunting party a couple of those big ugly ones came back and ate a whole mob of the dead I wanted to take out. We lost a lot of soldiers too while we were out too, good ones, and they died bad. Slow. I made sure of it, the traitors. These dinosaurs have gone too far. They're making us crazy. We need to rack up some serious numbers to catch up. We need some serious risk taking, I'm talking explosives and fire and drugs and rock and roll here. I don't care if it's living dinos or dead, they all need to be taken down.

|Seems like the only news we get here is bad. A weirdo family was staying outside the center, I don't know why. They said something about germs. Anyway, they're gone, vanished in the night. We sent a scout out to find them but now they're gone too. We have a pretty good idea of where in the woods the scout was searching. Bring back anyone you can alive and end whatever is keeping them.

|This is probably a waste of time, but a nearby farmer has been complaining that someone or something has been stealing a lot of their cattle. We don't normally bother with little things like this, but our food supplies are getting low and the farmers are threatening to cut us off if we won't help. I've marked on your map where the farmers think the cattle are going.

|NPC (Religious)
|St. Michael the archangel defend me in battle…
|As the world seems to abandon the reality that we once knew, it becomes plausible that the old superstitions that were cast aside may have had some truth to them. Please go and find me a religious relic… I doubt it will be of much use but I've got to hope in something. It will look like a normal rock to you, but I can divine secrets from its earthly essence.
|
|
|-
!Investigate Cult
|NPC (Religious)
|St. Michael the archangel defend me in battle…
|You have no idea how interesting this holy symbol is. I have two very promising leads… first things first, I have learned of dark whispers of mystic significance, telluric resonances that tingle the spine and give me kind of a dizzy feeling, but not entirely unpleasant. Could you investigate a location for me? I'm not sure what was going on here but the whispers seem fairly worried about it.
|
|
|-
!Mad Hermit
|NPC (Religious)
|St. Michael the archangel defend me in battle…
|I have another task if you are feeling up to it. There is a mad hermit that the whispers made special mention of. I was wondering if you could see what may have happened to them or if they left anything behind. The whispers admit the individual is rather unstable, to put it lightly, but the whispers believe the hermit was some kind of mystical visionary. I'm not in a position to cast out the account just yet… it seems the hermit has prophesied events accurately before.
|
|
|-
!Recover Holy Symbol
|NPC (Religious)
|St. Michael the archangel defend me in battle…
|I have learned so much from this sacred relic. I have attuned to it. We must go deeper. I now understand that buried in the deep forest is a special place with even larger rocks, I mean sacred relics. Go there, and get me a holy symbol of this place.

|Opener NPC
|I wonder if a retreat might exist…
|Everyone who dies gets back up, right? Which means that whatever is causing this it must be airborne to have infected everyone. I believe that if that is the case then there should be regions that were not downwind from where-ever the disease was released. We need to find a leather journal with all the weather patterns leading up to the outbreak.

!Gather cattail stalks to create cattail jelly
|Opener NPC
|Medical services are a little sparse here, but people have been surviving using their wits and the bounty of Mother Nature for a long time. Care to learn a little?
|Did you know that cattails are a source of a jelly that works as an antiseptic and analgesic? Something like that is likely to be mighty helpful out here. I want you to take this bag, head to the nearest swamp, collect 80 cattail stalks, and bring them back here. In exchange, I'll show you how to harvest the jelly.

|Your assistance is greatly appreciated, we need to clear out the more ruthless monsters that are wandering up from the lower levels.

|Necropolis Guard
|
|My communications team went to secure the radio control room after we breached the facility. I haven't heard from them since, I need you to locate them.

I'm sure they could probably use your help also.",

!Disable External Power
|Old Guard Necropolis
|
|I guess I could use your skills once again. There are small transmitters located in the nearby evacuation shelters; if we don't separate them from the power grid their power systems will rapidly deteriorate over the next few weeks. The task is rather simple but the shelters offer us a place to redirect refugees until this vault can be secured.

!Fabricate Repeater Mod
|Old Guard Necropolis
|My chief responsibility is to monitor radio traffic and locate potential targets to secure or rescue. The majority of radio repeaters are down and those that are working have only emergency power. If you have a basic understanding of electronics you should be able to fabricate the 'radio repeater mod' found in these plans. When this mod is attached to a radio station's main terminal, all short range radio traffic on emergency channels is boosted so we can pick it up at much longer ranges. I really need you make me one.
|
|
|
|-
!Install Repeater Mod
|Old Guard Necropolis
|
|Most of my essential gear has been brought back online so it is time for you to install your first radio repeater mod. Head topside and locate the nearest radio station. Install the mod on the backup terminal and return to me so that I can verify that everything was successful. Radio towers must unfortunately be ignored for now, without a dedicated emergency power system they won't be useful for some time.
|
|
|-
!Install Repeater Mod
|Old Guard Necropolis
|
|I could always use you to put another repeater mod up. I don't have to remind you but every one that goes up extends our response area just a little bit more. With enough of them we'll be able to maintain communication with anyone in the region.
