If the bird never picked up the team then we may still have a chance to meet up with them.  It includes an access code for the elevator and an encoded message for the team leader, I guess.  If we want to join up with what remains of the government then now may be our only chance.

In order to get a half dozen shovels and a couple of bags of seeds, we are going to have to trade for it.
